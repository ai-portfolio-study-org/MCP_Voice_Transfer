The recipient is \"철수\" (Chen Yi). The amount is \"오천 원\" which is 10,000. The response should be a natural Korean message. So the JSON should have intent as transfer, amount 10000, recipient \"철수\", and response \"엄마님께 10,000원을 송금해드릴까요?\".\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"intent\": \"transfer\",\n  \"amount\": 10000,\n  \"recipient\": \"철수\",\n  \"response\": \"엄마님께 10,000원을 송금해드릴까요?\"\n}"

    "raw_output": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user said \"만원만 보내줘\". Translating that, it's \"send only 10000 yuan\". The intent here is transfer because they want to send money. The amount is 10000, and the recipient is null since there's no mention of a person. The response should be a confirmation message.

    "raw_output": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user says, \"나 송금하고 싶어.\" So, the intent here is probably \"transfer\" because they're asking to make a transfer. The recipient isn't mentioned, so the recipient field would be null. The amount isn't specified, so the amount is also null. The response should be a confirmation or a simple message. Since they just said they want to transfer, the response could be something like \"30,000원을 송금해드릴까요?\" which is a natural Korean response.

The previous message was \"가스비 내야 하는데 어떻게 해야 해?\" which translates to \"I need to order gas here, how do I do that?\" \n\nFirst, I need to determine the intent. The user is asking for instructions on how to order gas, which is a request for help. The options given are transfer, confirm, cancel, inquiry, other, or system response. Since they're asking for help, the intent is likely \"inquiry\" because they want information.\n\nNext, the recipient. The user hasn't mentioned a specific person, so the recipient is null.\n\nThe amount is not mentioned, so it's null. The response should be a natural Korean answer. Since they're asking how to order gas, the response would be a step-by-step guide or a confirmation. But since the user hasn't specified a particular amount, maybe just a general answer. \n\nPutting it all together, the JSON should have intent as inquiry, amount as null, recipient as null, and the response as a natural Korean message.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"intent\": \"inquiry\",\n  \"amount\": null,\n  \"recipient\": null,\n  \"response\": \"가스비를 구매하시면 안내를 받으실 수 있습니다. 더 구체적인 정보가 필요하시면 알려주세요.\"\n}"

    "raw_output": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user asked, \"내 계좌에 얼마 남았어?\" which translates to \"How much money is left in my account?\" So the intent here is to inquire about the remaining balance. The recipient is the user, so we leave recipient as null. The amount is not specified, so it's null. The response should be a natural Korean question, maybe asking how much is left. But according to the example, if the intent is inquiry, the response is just the question. Wait, the example shows when the intent is inquiry, the response is the question. So in this case, the response would be \"내 계좌에 얼마 남았어?\" itself. But the user might be asking for confirmation or something else. Wait, no, the user is asking about the remaining balance. So the correct response is to ask how much is left. But according to the format, the response should be the natural response. So maybe just the question. But the example shows when the intent is inquiry, the response is the question. So in this case, the response is \"내 계좌에 얼마 남았어?\" which is the same as the user's question. But maybe the user is asking for confirmation. Wait, no. The user is asking about the remaining balance. So the intent is inquiry, and the response is the question. So the JSON would have intent as inquiry, recipient as null, amount as null, and response as the question. But the example shows when the intent is inquiry, the response is the question. So the correct JSON would be:\n\n{\n  \"intent\": \"inquiry\",\n  \"amount\": null,\n  \"recipient\": null,\n  \"response\": \"내 계좌에 얼마 남았어?\"\n}\n\nBut the user's question is exactly the same as the response. So that's correct. Alternatively, maybe the response is just the question, but the example shows the response as the question. So yes, that's the right approach.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"intent\": \"inquiry\",\n  \"amount\": null,\n  \"recipient\": null,\n  \"response\": \"내 계좌에 얼마 남았어?\"\n}"

The recipient is the person mentioned, which is \"그 사람\" (the person mentioned). The amount isn't specified, so it's null. The response should be a confirmation or a request to send again. The response should be in Korean, natural, and avoid using Hanja. So the JSON should have intent as transfer, amount as null, recipient as \"그 사람\", and the response as \"그 사람에게 다시 전송해 드릴까요?\" or something similar.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"intent\": \"transfer\",\n  \"amount\": null,\n  \"recipient\": \"그 사람\",\n  \"response\": \"그 사람에게 다시 전송해 드릴까요?\"\n}"

    "raw_output": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user said, \"아까랑 똑같이 보내줘.\" Translating that, it's \"Send the same as before.\" So the intent here is \"transfer\" because they want to send something. The recipient is \"아까\" which means \"before\" in Korean, but since it's a reference to the previous message, maybe the recipient is null. The amount is also null because there's no mention of a specific amount. The response should be a confirmation or a request, like \"Send the same as before.\" But since the user just said \"보내줘,\" maybe the response is \"Send the same as before.\" But according to the format, the response should be in Korean and natural. So the JSON would have intent as transfer, amount null, recipient null, and response \"Send the same as before.\"\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"intent\": \"transfer\",\n  \"amount\": null,\n  \"recipient\": null,\n  \"response\": \"아까랑 똑같이 보내줘\"\n}"

The amount isn't specified, so I'll leave it as null. The recipient isn't mentioned, so I'll set that to null. The response should be a confirmation or request, maybe asking if they want to proceed. Let me make sure the JSON format is correct with the required fields.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"intent\": \"transfer\",\n  \"amount\": null,\n  \"recipient\": null,\n  \"response\": \"송금을 요청해 드릴까요?\"\n}"

    "text": "이체 수수료 얼마야?",
    "raw_output": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user asked, \"이체 수수료 얼마야?\" which translates to \"What is the transfer fee?\" So the intent here is to confirm the transfer fee. The amount is not specified, so it's null. The recipient isn't mentioned, so it's also null. The response should be a natural Korean confirmation, maybe asking for the amount. Let me check the example again. The example for confirm is \"30,000원 송금 요청으로 확인했습니다.\" So the response should be something like confirming the fee. Alright, that's it.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"intent\": \"confirm\",\n  \"amount\": null,\n  \"recipient\": null,\n  \"response\": \"이체 수수료는 5000원입니다. 요청하신 송금을 확인해 드릴까요?\"\n}"

Now, I need to determine the intent, recipient, amount, and response based on this.\n\nThe intent here is probably \"confirm\" because they're confirming that they had lunch with their father. The recipient is their father, so that's \"아빠\". The amount isn't mentioned, so it's null. The response should be a natural Korean message confirming the lunch. I need to make sure the response is in Korean and matches the intent. Let me check the example again to ensure I follow the format correctly.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"intent\": \"confirm\",\n  \"amount\": null,\n  \"recipient\": \"아빠\",\n  \"response\": \"아빠님께 점심을 먹었어 확인했습니다.\"\n}"

  {
    "text": "아빠한테 이만원 보내줘",
    "raw_output": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user said \"아빠한테 이만원 보내줘\". The key here is to determine the intent, recipient, amount, and response based on the given message.\n\nFirst, the intent. The phrase \"보내줘\" is a request to send something. The amount is \"이만원\", which translates to \"this much money\". Since the user is sending money to their father, the intent is likely \"transfer\" because it's about sending money.\n\nNext, the recipient. The message mentions \"아빠\" which is the father's name. So the recipient is \"아빠\".\n\nThe amount is \"이만원\", which is 10,000원. So the amount should be 10000.\n\nThe response needs to be natural Korean. Since the user is asking to send money, the response should confirm or ask for the amount. The example response uses \"엄마한테...\" which is similar. So the response would be something like \"아빠님께 10,000원을 송금해드릴까요?\" which is a polite confirmation.\n\nI need to make sure all fields are correctly filled. The intent is transfer, amount is 10000, recipient is \"아빠\", and the response is as above. No other intent or fields are present here.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"intent\": \"transfer\",\n  \"amount\": 10000,\n  \"recipient\": \"아빠\",\n  \"response\": \"아빠님께 10,000원을 송금해드릴까요?\"\n}"

    "raw_output": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user said \"여보한테 십만 원 이체해줘\". First, I need to determine the intent. The phrase \"이체해줘\" is the action of transferring money, so the intent is transfer. The amount is 100,000 won. The recipient is \"여보한테\", which is \"her mother\" or \"her mother\". Since it's a direct reference, I'll put \"여보한테\" as the recipient. The response should be a confirmation message, so \"여보한테 100,000원을 송금해드릴까요?\" makes sense. No other intent or details are needed here.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"intent\": \"transfer\",\n  \"amount\": 100000,\n  \"recipient\": \"여보한테\",\n  \"response\": \"여보한테 100,000원을 송금해드릴까요?\"\n}"

  {
    "text": "보내지 마",
    "raw_output": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user said \"보내지 마\" which translates to \"Don't send it.\" The intent here is probably a cancel. Since they didn't make a transfer request, the intent is cancel. The amount and recipient are null because there's no mention of sending or receiving. The response should be a confirmation that the action was canceled. So the JSON should have intent as cancel, amount null, recipient null, and the response explaining the cancellation.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"intent\": \"cancel\",\n  \"amount\": null,\n  \"recipient\": null,\n  \"response\": \"요청하신 송금을 취소했습니다.\"\n}"

The user said \"그냥 넘어가줘\" which translates to \"Just go ahead.\" But the instructions mention that the intent should be one of transfer, confirm, cancel, inquiry, other, or system_response. The user's message doesn't seem to involve any transaction, confirmation, cancellation, or inquiry. It's more of a general instruction. So the intent here should be \"other\" because there's no specific action requested. The recipient is null since there's no mention of a person. The amount and response also don't apply here. I need to make sure I'm not missing any context. Yep, that's right. So the JSON should have intent as \"other\", recipient as null, amount as null, and the response as a natural Korean message.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"intent\": \"other\",\n  \"amount\": null,\n  \"recipient\": null,\n  \"response\": \"내용을 알려주세요.\"\n}"

    "raw_output": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user said, \"아, 삼만원 보내는 거였지.\" So first, I need to determine the intent. The phrase \"보내는 거였지\" is a confirmation of sending a transaction. The intent here is likely \"confirm\" because they're confirming that they sent the money. The amount is 30,000, so the amount should be 30000. The recipient is mentioned as \"삼만원\" which translates to \"three million,\" but since the user didn't specify a name, the recipient is null. The response should be a natural Korean confirmation, so \"30,000원을 송금 요청으로 확인했습니다.\" That makes sense.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"intent\": \"confirm\",\n  \"amount\": 30000,\n  \"recipient\": null,\n  \"response\": \"30,000원 송금 요청으로 확인했습니다.\"\n}"

The options given are transfer, confirm, cancel, inquiry, other, or system_response. Since the user is asking for information about who to send to, the intent is \"inquiry\" because they want to confirm or ask about the recipient. The recipient is not specified, so we leave that as null. The amount and response need to be handled accordingly. The response should be a natural Korean message asking who to send to. Let me make sure there's no other intent here.
