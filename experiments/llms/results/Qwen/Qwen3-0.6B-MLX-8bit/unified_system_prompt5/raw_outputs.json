    "text": "철수한테 오천 원 보내줘",
    "raw_output": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wrote \"철수한테 오천 원 보내줘\". The first thing I notice is that \"철수\" is the name, which is \"Chen\" in Korean. The phrase \"오천 원\" translates to \"3000 yuan\" in English. The action is to send 3000 yuan to \"철수\".\n\nLooking at the intent options, \"transfer\" is the correct one here because it's about sending money. The amount is 3000, the recipient is \"철수\", and the response should be a confirmation message. The previous examples show that when the intent is transfer, the response includes the amount and recipient. So I need to structure the response accordingly.\n\nWait, but in the example given, the response is \"엄마님께 30,000원을 송금해드릴까요?\" which is a confirmation. So the response here should be similar. Also, the amount is explicitly mentioned as 3000, so it's okay to include that. The recipient is \"철수\", so that's correct. No need for null for recipient or amount here. The user's message is clear, so the response should be straightforward.\n</think>\n\n{\"intent\": \"transfer\", \"amount\": 30000, \"recipient\": \"철수\", \"response\": \"철수님께 30,000원을 송금해드릴까요?\"}"

  {
    "text": "엄마한테 3만원만",
    "raw_output": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wrote \"엄마한테 3만원만\". The intent here is probably to confirm the transfer. The amount is 30000, recipient is \"엄마\", and the response would be a confirmation message. But wait, the user just said \"3만원만\" without specifying the amount. Oh, but in Korean, \"3만원\" is 30,000. So maybe the amount is 30,000. The recipient is \"엄마\". The response should be a confirmation. So the answer should be intent: transfer, amount: 30000, recipient: \"엄마\", response: \"엄마님께 30,000원을 송금해드릴까요?\".\n</think>\n\n{\"intent\": \"transfer\", \"amount\": 30000, \"recipient\": \"엄마\", \"response\": \"엄마님께 30,000원을 송금해드릴까요?\"}"
  },
  {
    "text": "만원만 보내줘",
    "raw_output": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user says \"만원만 보내줘\". Translating that, it's \"Send only 30,000.\" So the intent here is to transfer, right? The amount is 30,000. The recipient is the person they want to send it to, which in this case is the user. But wait, the original text is just \"만원만 보내줘\", so maybe the recipient is the user themselves? Or is there a recipient mentioned? Hmm, the example given in the previous messages had \"엄마\" (Mom) as the recipient. But here, the user is just saying \"send only 30,000\", so maybe the recipient is the user. But the example uses \"recipient\" as a separate field. Wait, in the example, the user says \"엄마한테\" (to Mom), and the response includes \"recipient\" as \"엄마\". So maybe in this case, the recipient is the user. But the amount is 30,000. So the intent is transfer, amount is 30000, recipient is null (since there's no specific recipient mentioned), and the response is \"만원만 보내시고, 30,000원을 보냅니다.\" Wait, but the user's text is \"만원만 보내줘\", which is just a command. So maybe the response should be a confirmation or a request. Let me check the previous examples. The user's text \"보내지 마\" leads to cancel intent, and \"아, 삼만원 보내는 거였지\" leads to confirm. So here, the user is just saying \"send only 30,000\", so the response should be a confirmation. So the intent is transfer, amount is 30000, recipient is null, and the response is \"30,000원을 보냅니다.\" But the user's text is \"만원만 보내줘\", which is a command. So maybe the response is \"30,000원을 보냅니다.\" But the example for confirm uses \"response\" as a confirmation. So I think the correct answer here is intent: transfer, amount: 30000, recipient: null, response: \"30,000원을 보냅니다.\"\n</think>\n\n{\"intent\": \"transfer\", \"amount\": 30000, \"recipient\": null, \"response\": \"30,000원을 보냅니다.\"}"

    "text": "엄마한테 보내줘",
    "raw_output": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user says \"엄마한테 보내줘\". The intent here is to send something to the mother. The amount is not specified, so I'll leave it as null. The recipient is \"엄마\", which is the mother. The response should be a confirmation that the message is sent. So the structure would be intent: transfer, amount: null, recipient: \"엄마\", response: \"엄마님께 메시지를 보냅니다.\"\n</think>\n\n{\"intent\": \"transfer\", \"amount\": null, \"recipient\": \"엄마\", \"response\": \"엄마님께 메시지를 보냅니다.\"}"

    "text": "나 송금하고 싶어",

The recipient is not mentioned, so also null. The response should be a confirmation message. Since the user just wants to request sending, the response would be something like \"송금하실 대상과 금액을 말씀해주세요.\" which translates to \"Please specify the recipient and amount.\" That matches the example given earlier. I need to make sure the intent is correct and the rest are null as per the instructions.\n</think>\n\n{\"intent\": \"transfer\", \"amount\": null, \"recipient\": null, \"response\": \"송금하실 대상과 금액을 말씀해주세요.\"}"

    "raw_output": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking how to get gas money. The previous message was \"가스비 내야 하는데 어떻게 해야 해?\" which translates to \"I need gas money, how can I do it?\" \n\nLooking at the options, the intent here is probably \"inquiry\" because they're asking for information. The amount is not specified, so we leave it as null. The recipient isn't mentioned, so we leave it as null. The response should be a natural Korean answer. Since they're asking how to get gas money, the response would be a simple explanation. The user might need to provide the amount or specify the recipient, but since they didn't, just a general answer is needed.\n</think>\n\n{\"intent\": \"inquiry\", \"amount\": null, \"recipient\": null, \"response\": \"가스비를 내고 이용해주세요. 금액이나 대상 정보를 알려주시면 더 구체적인 안내가 가능합니다.\"}"

    "text": "내 계좌에 얼마 남았어?",
    "raw_output": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking, \"내 계좌에 얼마 남았어?\" which translates to \"How much money is left in my account?\" \n\nFirst, I need to determine the intent. Since they're asking about their account balance, that's likely a request to confirm or inquire about the amount. The intent here is probably \"inquiry\" because it's about information retrieval.\n\nNext, the amount. The user hasn't specified a particular amount, so I should leave it as null. The recipient is not mentioned, so also set it to null. The response should be a natural Korean inquiry asking for the amount.\n\nI need to make sure the response is in Korean and matches the example. The example shows a question like \"30,000원 송금 요청으로 확인했습니다.\" So the response here should be similar, but since it's an inquiry, maybe just a simple question to get the amount.\n\nDouble-checking the rules: intent is \"inquiry\", amount and recipient are null, response is the inquiry question. Yep, that's correct.\n</think>\n\n{\"intent\": \"inquiry\", \"amount\": null, \"recipient\": null, \"response\": \"계좌에서 남은 금액을 알려주세요.\"}"

The options given are transfer, confirm, cancel, inquiry, other, or system response. Since the user is asking to send again, the intent is likely 'transfer' with the recipient being the person mentioned. The amount and response need to be filled in. The amount is not specified, so it's null. The response should be a confirmation or request for sending again. The example shows that if the user says \"보내지 마\", the intent is cancel, so here, maybe the response is \"보내시겠어요?\" to confirm sending again. Let me check the previous examples to ensure consistency. Yes, the response should be a natural Korean message. So the final answer should have intent as transfer, amount as null, recipient as the person, and the response as the confirmation.\n</think>\n\n{\"intent\": \"transfer\", \"amount\": null, \"recipient\": \"그 사람\", \"response\": \"그 사람한테 다시 보내시겠어요?\"}"

    "raw_output": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user says \"아까랑 똑같이 보내줘\". Translating that, it's \"I sent the same thing as before.\" \n\nFirst, I need to determine the intent. Since they're referring to sending the same thing as before, the intent is likely \"transfer\" because it's about sending money or something similar. \n\nNext, the amount. The text doesn't mention a specific amount, so I should set \"amount\" to null. \n\nThe recipient is not specified, so \"recipient\" remains null. \n\nThe response should be a natural Korean message. Since they're confirming the action, maybe a simple confirmation. But the original text is just \"아까랑 똑같이 보내줘\", which is a confirmation. So the response would be something like \"요청하신 송금을 확인했습니다.\" \n\nWait, but the user might just be confirming the action without specifying an amount. So the response should be a confirmation message. Let me check the example again. In the previous examples, when the user says \"보내지 마\", the response is \"요청하신 송금을 취소했습니다.\" So similar structure. \n\nSo putting it all together: intent is transfer, amount is null, recipient is null, response is \"요청하신 송금을 확인했습니다.\"\n</think>\n\n{\"intent\": \"transfer\", \"amount\": null, \"recipient\": null, \"response\": \"요청하신 송금을 확인했습니다.\"}"

    "raw_output": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user said \"송금할래\" which translates to \"Send it now.\" The task is to extract intent, amount, recipient, and response from this text.\n\nFirst, the intent. The user is asking to send something, so the intent is likely \"transfer\" because it's about making a transfer. The amount is not specified here, so we leave it as null. The recipient isn't mentioned, so also leave it as null. The response should be a natural Korean message. Since the user just said \"Send it now,\" the response would be a confirmation or a request for details. But since there's no amount or recipient mentioned, the response would be something like \"송금하실 대상과 금액을 말씀해주세요.\" which asks for the recipient and amount. \n\nWait, but the user's text is just \"송금할래\" which is a direct command. In the example, when the user says \"송금할래,\" the response is \"송금하실 대상과 금액을 말씀해주세요.\" So that's correct. The amount and recipient are both null here. So the final answer should be intent: transfer, amount: null, recipient: null, response: \"송금하실 대상과 금액을 말씀해주세요.\"\n</think>\n\n{\"intent\": \"transfer\", \"amount\": null, \"recipient\": null, \"response\": \"송금하실 대상과 금액을 말씀해주세요.\"}"

The intent here is to confirm the transfer fee. The amount is not specified, so it should be null. The recipient is not mentioned, so it's also null. The response should be a confirmation message about the fee.

The user is talking about having lunch with their father, which is a general statement. The options are transfer, confirm, cancel, inquiry, other, or system response. Since there's no mention of sending money or canceling something, the intent here is likely \"inquiry\" because they're asking for information about lunch with their father. \n\nNext, the amount. The text doesn't mention any amount, so I should set the amount to null. The recipient is also not specified, so set that to null as well. The response should be a natural Korean message. Since the user is just stating their lunch with their father, the response would be something like, \"아빠랑 점심 먹었어! 감사합니다.\" \n\nI need to make sure all the fields are correctly filled and follow the format.

But the text is a bit vague. The user might just want to proceed without specifying the amount or recipient. So the intent would be \"transfer\" with amount and recipient as null. The response would be a confirmation or a request for details. \n\nWait, but the user's message is \"그냥 넘어가줘\" which is a simple \"Just go ahead.\" So maybe the intent is \"transfer\" but with no amount or recipient.
