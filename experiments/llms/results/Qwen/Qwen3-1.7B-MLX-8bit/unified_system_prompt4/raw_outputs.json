    "raw_output": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user says, \"철수한테 오천 원 보내줘\". First, I need to determine the intent. The key words here are \"보내줘\" which is \"send\" in Korean, and \"철수한테\" which is \"to Jeongsoo\". So the intent is definitely transfer.\n\nNext, the amount. \"오천 원\" is \"5000 won\" in Korean. So the amount should be 5000. The recipient is Jeongsoo, so that's \"철수\".\n\nNow, the response. The example given for a transfer is asking if they want to send the amount. So the response should be something like, \"Jeongsoo님께 5,000원을 송금해드릴까요?\" which translates to \"Will you send 5,000 won to Jeongsoo?\"\n\nI need to make sure there are no other intents. The user isn't asking to confirm, cancel, or inquire. So the intent is transfer. The amount is 5000, recipient is Jeongsoo.

The recipient is \"엄마\" which is mom. The response should be a confirmation. The example given for \"transfer\" has \"송금하실 대상과 금액을 말씀해주세요.\" So, I need to adapt that. The response should be something like \"엄마님께 30,000원을 송금해드릴까요?\" which is a natural Korean response asking if they want to send the money. Let me check if there are any other possible intents. The user isn't asking for confirmation, cancel, or inquiry. So the intent is transfer. The amount is 30,000, recipient is mom. The response is the confirmation question. That seems right.\n</think>\n\n{\"intent\": \"transfer\", \"amount\": 30000, \"recipient\": \"엄마\", \"response\": \"엄마님께 30,000원을 송금해드릴까요?\"}"

    "text": "만원만 보내줘",
    "raw_output": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user said \"만원만 보내줘\". First, I need to determine the intent. The word \"보내줘\" is a common way to ask to send money, so the intent is likely transfer. The amount is \"만원\" which is 10,000 won. The recipient isn't mentioned, so it's null. The response should be a confirmation question. The example given for \"삼만원 보내줘\" uses \"송금하실 대상과 금액을 말씀해주세요.\" So for 10,000 won, it would be \"10,000원 송금 요청으로 확인했습니다.\" But I need to make sure the response is in Korean and natural. Let me check the example again. Yes, the response is a natural Korean sentence. So the final answer should have intent as transfer, amount as 10000, recipient null, and the response as \"10,000원 송금 요청으로 확인했습니다.\"\n</think>\n\n{\"intent\": \"transfer\", \"amount\": 10000, \"recipient\": null, \"response\": \"10,000원 송금 요청으로 확인했습니다.\"}"

    "raw_output": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wrote \"엄마한테 보내줘\". First, I need to determine the intent. The word \"보내줘\" is a common way to say \"send\" or \"send to\" in Korean. So the intent here is likely \"transfer\". \n\nNext, the amount. The user didn't mention any specific amount, so the amount should be null.\n\nThe recipient is \"엄마\" which is \"mother\" in Korean, so the recipient is \"엄마\".\n\nFor the response, the system needs to ask for the amount and recipient again. But since the user already mentioned the recipient, maybe the response should confirm the transfer. Wait, but the example shows that when the user says \"송금할래\" the response is asking for the target and amount. Here, the user just says \"엄마한테 보내줘\", which is \"send to mother\". So the response should be asking for the amount. But the user didn't specify an amount, so the response would be \"요청하신 금액과 대상이 무엇인지 알려주세요.\" (Please tell me the amount and target.)\n\nWait, but in the example, when the user says \"엄마한테 삼만원 보내줘\", the response is asking for confirmation. But here, the user hasn't specified an amount. So the response should be asking for the amount again. So the response would be \"요청하신 금액과 대상이 무엇인지 알려주세요.\" \n\nSo putting it all together: intent is transfer, amount is null, recipient is 엄마, response is the question about amount and recipient.\n</think>\n\n{\"intent\": \"transfer\", \"amount\": null, \"recipient\": \"엄마\", \"response\": \"요청하신 금액과 대상이 무엇인지 알려주세요.\"}"

But I need to check if there's an amount or recipient mentioned.\n\nThe text doesn't mention any specific amount or recipient. The user just says they want to send money. So amount is null, recipient is null. The response should be a confirmation asking for the details. Like, \"송금하실 대상과 금액을 말씀해주세요.\" which translates to \"Please tell me the recipient and the amount you want to send.\"\n\nI need to make sure the response is natural Korean. Let me check the example again. For instance, when they said \"엄마한테 삼만원 보내줘\", the response was \"엄마님께 30,000원을 송금해드릴까요?\" So here, the response should be similar but for the user's request. So the response would be \"송금하실 대상과 금액을 말씀해주세요.\"\n</think>\n\n{\"intent\": \"transfer\", \"amount\": null, \"recipient\": null, \"response\": \"송금하실 대상과 금액을 말씀해주세요.\"}"

    "raw_output": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking, \"가스비 내야 하는데 어떻게 해야 해?\" which translates to \"I need to pay the gas fee, how do I do that?\" So, the intent here is probably about paying a gas fee. But looking at the possible intents, the options are transfer, confirm, cancel, inquiry, other, or system_response.\n\nFirst, the user is asking how to pay the gas fee, which is a request for information. The intent might be \"inquiry\" since they're asking for guidance on how to proceed. But let me check the other options. \"Transfer\" would be if they want to send money, but they're asking how to pay, not necessarily to send. \"Confirm\" is for confirming a previous action, which doesn't fit here. \"Cancel\" would be if they want to stop something, which isn't the case. \"Other\" is for everyday stuff, but gas fee is a specific service. \"System_response\" is for system replies, which isn't here.\n\nSo the intent is likely \"inquiry\". The amount is not mentioned, so it's null. The recipient is not specified either, so null. The response should be a natural Korean response guiding them on how to pay the gas fee. Maybe something like \"가스비를 내기 위해 필요한 절차를 알려드릴게요.\" But I need to make sure it's in the correct format. Let me check the example again. For instance, when they asked to send money, the response was a question asking for the recipient and amount. Here, since they're asking how to pay, the response should be a step-by-step guide or instructions. So the response would be something like \"가스비를 내기 위해 전자지급, 계좌이체, 또는 현금으로 결제할 수 있습니다. 구체적인 방법은 고객센터에 문의하시기 바랍니다.\" But the example responses are more concise. Maybe \"가스비를 내기 위해 전자지급, 계좌이체, 또는 현금으로 결제할 수 있습니다. 구체적인 방법은 고객센터에 문의하시기 바랍니다.\" But the user might need a more direct answer. Alternatively, \"가스비를 내기 위해 필요한 정보를 알려드릴게요.\" But I need to make sure it's natural. The example for \"confirm\" had a response like \"30,000원 송금 요청으로 확인했습니다.\" So here, the response should be a confirmation or guidance. Maybe \"가스비를 내기 위해 필요한 정보를 알려드릴게요.\" But the user is asking how to do it, so maybe a step-by-step. However, the system might not have that info, so the response would be a general guide. So the final answer would be intent: inquiry, amount: null, recipient: null, response: \"가스비를 내기 위해 전자지급, 계좌이체, 또는 현금으로 결제할 수 있습니다. 구체적인 방법은 고객센터에 문의하시기 바랍니다.\"\n</think>\n\n{\"intent\": \"inquiry\", \"amount\": null, \"recipient\": null, \"response\": \"가스비를 내기 위해 전자지급, 계좌이체, 또는 현금으로 결제할 수 있습니다. 구체적인 방법은 고객센터에 문의하시기 바랍니다.\"}"

    "raw_output": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking, \"내 계좌에 얼마 남았어?\" which translates to \"How much is left in my account?\" in Korean. \n\nFirst, I need to determine the intent. The intent here is likely \"inquiry\" because the user is asking about the balance in their account, which is a request for information. The options include \"inquiry\" as one of the categories.\n\nNext, the amount. The user is asking about the balance, so the amount would be null because they haven't specified a particular amount. The recipient is the user's account, but since the user is asking about their own account, the recipient isn't specified here. So recipient would be null.\n\nFor the response, the system needs to provide a natural Korean response. The response should be something like, \"계좌 잔액을 확인해 드릴게요.\" which means \"I will check your account balance for you.\"\n\nI need to make sure that the intent is correctly categorized as \"inquiry\" and that the other fields are set appropriately. There's no mention of transferring money or canceling, so the intent isn't transfer, confirm, cancel, or system_response. Therefore, the final answer should have intent as \"inquiry\", amount as null, recipient as null, and the response in Korean.\n</think>\n\n{\"intent\": \"inquiry\", \"amount\": null, \"recipient\": null, \"response\": \"계좌 잔액을 확인해 드릴게요.\"}"

    "text": "그 사람한테 또 보내줘",
    "raw_output": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wrote \"그 사람한테 또 보내줘\". So, first, I need to figure out the intent. The words \"보내줘\" mean \"send it\", so the intent is likely transfer. But \"또\" means \"again\" or \"another time\", so the user is asking to send again to the same person. \n\nNext, the amount. The text doesn't mention any specific amount, so the amount should be null.\n\nRecipient is \"그 사람\" which is \"that person\", so the recipient is \"그 사람\".\n\nResponse needs to be a natural Korean response. The user is asking to send again, so the response should confirm the action. Like, \"그 사람님께 다시 10,000원을 송금해드릴까요?\" but since the amount isn't specified, maybe just confirm the action without the amount. Wait, but the example shows that if the amount is not specified, they ask for it. But in this case, the user is asking to send again, so maybe the response is \"그 사람님께 다시 송금해드릴까요?\" but the example shows that when the amount is not specified, they ask for it. However, in this case, the user is not providing the amount, so the response should be a confirmation that they want to send again, but without the amount. So maybe \"그 사람님께 다시 송금해드릴까요?\" \n\nWait, but the example for \"송금할래\" has the response asking for the recipient and amount. So in this case, since the user is asking to send again, but doesn't mention the amount, the response should be asking for the amount again. But the user's message is \"그 사람한테 또 보내줘\" which is just \"send again to that person\". So maybe the response is \"그 사람님께 다시 송금해드릴까요?\" but the amount is not specified. So the amount is null, recipient is \"그 사람\", intent is transfer. \n\nSo the final answer would be intent: transfer, amount: null, recipient: \"그 사람\", response: \"그 사람님께 다시 송금해드릴까요?\"\n</think>\n\n{\"intent\": \"transfer\", \"amount\": null, \"recipient\": \"그 사람\", \"response\": \"그 사람님께 다시 송금해드릴까요?\"}"

The key here is \"보내줘\" which is \"send\" in Korean. The user is asking to send something similar to what was sent before. So the intent is likely \"transfer\" because they're talking about sending money or something similar.\n\nNext, the amount. The user didn't mention any specific amount, so that's null. The recipient is \"아까\" which is \"before\" in Korean, but the user is referring to the previous send. However, in the example, when someone says \"아까랑 똑같이 보내줘,\" the recipient is not specified, so it's null. But wait, maybe \"아까\" is the recipient from the previous message. But since the previous message isn't provided here, I can't know. So I'll leave recipient as null.\n\nThe response should be a natural Korean response. The user is asking to send the same as before, so the response would be something like, \"전송을 확인해드릴까요?\" or \"아까와 같은 내용을 전송해드릴까요?\" But the example for \"confirm\" has \"30,000원 송금 요청으로 확인했습니다.\" So maybe the response is \"전송을 확인해드릴까요?\".\n\nWait, but the user is not confirming a previous transfer, but asking to send the same as before. So the intent is \"transfer\" with amount null, recipient null, and response asking to confirm the transfer. But the example for \"confirm\" has the user confirming a previous request. So maybe the user is asking to send the same as before, which is a new transfer. So the intent is \"transfer\" with amount null, recipient null, and response asking to confirm the transfer. But the example for \"confirm\" is when the user confirms a previous transfer. So in this case, the user is not confirming but asking to send the same as before, which might be a new transfer. So the intent is \"transfer\" with amount null, recipient null, and response asking to confirm the transfer. But the example for \"confirm\" is when the user confirms a previous request.

The user is talking about having lunch with their father. The keywords here are \"점심 먹었어\" which means \"had lunch\". There's no mention of transferring money, confirming something, canceling, or inquiry. So the intent isn't transfer, confirm, cancel, or inquiry. It's probably a general statement, so maybe \"other\"? But the example given for \"other\" is when the conversation is unrelated. Since the user is just talking about lunch, it's not a system response either. So maybe \"other\"?\n\nAmount: The message doesn't mention any money, so amount is null.\n\nRecipient: The user mentions \"아빠\" which is \"father\", so recipient is \"아빠\".\n\nResponse: The response should be a natural Korean reply. Since the user is just informing about lunch, the response could be something like \"좋아요, 아빠와 점심을 먹었어요!\" or \"그렇군요, 아빠와 점심을 먹었어.\"\n\nWait, but the example for \"other\" has a response like \"요청하신 송금을 취소했습니다.\" So maybe in this case, the response is a general acknowledgment. But the user's message is just a statement, not a request. So the response should be a natural reply to their message. So maybe \"좋아요, 아빠와 점심을 먹었어요!\" or similar.\n\nBut according to the instructions, the response should be a natural Korean guidance. Wait, the example for \"other\" has a response like \"요청하신 송금을 취소했습니다.\" which is a system response. But in this case, the user is just talking about lunch, so the response should be a normal reply. So the response would be something like \"아빠와 점심을 먹었어요!\" or \"좋아요, 아빠와 점심을 먹었어!\"\n\nBut the user's message is a statement, so the response should be a reply to that. So maybe \"좋아요, 아빠와 점심을 먹었어요!\" or similar.\n\nSo putting it all together: intent is \"other\", amount is null, recipient is \"아빠\", response is \"좋아요, 아빠와 점심을 먹었어요!\".\n</think>\n\n{\"intent\": \"other\", \"amount\": null, \"recipient\": \"아빠\", \"response\": \"아빠와 점심을 먹었어요!\"}"

In the first example, they used \"엄마\" and asked for the transfer. So here, it should be \"아빠님께 50,000원을 송금해드릴까요?\".\n\nWait, but the amount is \"이만원\" which is 50,000. So the amount is 50000.

The key words here are \"이체해줘\" which means \"transfer\" or \"transfer to\". So the intent is likely \"transfer\".\n\nNext, the amount. \"십만 원\" is 100,000 won. So the amount should be 100000. The recipient is \"여보\" which is \"you\" in Korean, so the recipient is \"여보\".\n\nNow, the response. The example given for \"transfer\" is asking if the amount and recipient are correct.

The possible intents are transfer, confirm, cancel, inquiry, other, or system_response. The user is asking to just go ahead, so maybe they're confirming something or maybe it's a cancel. But the sentence is straightforward. \"넘어가자\" means \"go ahead\" or \"just proceed\". So maybe it's a confirmation or a cancel? Wait, but the user is not mentioning any transfer or cancel. They just want to proceed. So maybe it's a system_response? Or maybe it's a confirmation of a previous action. But the sentence is \"just go ahead\", so perhaps the intent is confirm. But I need to check the examples. For example, when the user says \"송금할래\" it's transfer, and \"보내지 마\" is cancel. So \"그냥 넘어가줘\" is similar to \"보내지 마\" but not exactly. It's more like \"just go ahead\" rather than canceling. So maybe the intent is confirm? Or maybe it's other? Because it's not a transfer, cancel, or inquiry. But the user is asking to proceed, so maybe it's a system_response. But the system_response is for when the system needs to ask for more info. Alternatively, maybe it's a confirmation of a previous action. But without context, it's hard to tell. However, the user hasn't mentioned any previous action, so maybe it's a system_response. But the example for system_response is when the system asks for more info. So if the user is just saying \"go ahead\", maybe it's a system_response. But the response would be something like \"진행을 확인해 드릴까요?\" or similar. But the user's sentence is \"그냥 넘어가줘\" which is \"just go ahead\". So the response would be a confirmation that they want to proceed. So maybe the intent is confirm. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's other because it's not a standard intent. But the user is asking to proceed, which is a common action. So maybe the intent is confirm. But I need to check the examples again. For example, when the user says \"송금할래\" it's transfer. \"보내지 마\" is cancel. \"아, 삼만원 보내는 거였지\" is confirm. So \"그냥 넘어가줘\" is similar to \"송금할래\" but not exactly. It's more like \"just proceed\" rather than a transfer. So maybe the intent is other. Because it's not a transfer, cancel, confirm, or inquiry. So the intent would be other. The amount is null, recipient is null. The response would be something like \"진행을 확인해 드릴까요?\" or \"요청하신 내용을 진행해 드릴까요?\" But the user's sentence is \"그냥 넘어가줘\" which is \"just go ahead\", so the response would be a confirmation that they want to proceed.

So the final answer would be intent: other, amount: null, recipient: null, response: \"진행을 확인해 드릴까요?\"\n</think>\n\n{\"intent\": \"other\", \"amount\": null, \"recipient\": null, \"response\": \"진행을 확인해 드릴까요?\"}"

For instance, when the user says \"송금할래\", the response is \"송금하실 대상과 금액을 말씀해주세요.\" So here, the response is a request for details. So in this case, the response should be similar, asking for the amount and recipient.\n\nSo putting it all together: intent is transfer, amount is null, recipient is null, response is \"예금을 처리해드릴까요?\" or \"예금하실 금액과 수령자 이름을 알려주세요.\"\n</think>\n\n{\"intent\": \"transfer\", \"amount\": null, \"recipient\": null, \"response\": \"예금하실 금액과 수령자 이름을 알려주세요.\"}"

    "text": "누구한테 보낼까요?",
    "raw_output": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking \"누구한테 보낼까요?\" which translates to \"Who should I send it to?\" in English. The intent here is to know the recipient of a transfer. But the user hasn't specified who yet. The previous example shows that when someone asks who to send money to, the intent is usually 'inquiry' because they need information. However, in the given example, the user's message is a question, so the intent might be 'inquiry' or 'confirm' if they're confirming a previous request. But since there's no prior context, it's more likely an inquiry. The amount is null because they haven't mentioned any amount. The recipient is null since they're asking who to send it to. The response should be a natural Korean response asking for the recipient's name. So the intent is 'inquiry', amount is null, recipient is null, and the response is asking for the recipient's name.\n</think>\n\n{\"intent\": \"inquiry\", \"amount\": null, \"recipient\": null, \"response\": \"받으실 사람의 이름을 알려주세요.\"}"
