    "raw_output": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wrote \"철수한테 오천 원 보내줘\". So, they want to send 100,000 won to Seo Young. Wait, no, \"오천 원\" is 100,000 won? Wait, \"오천\" is 1,000, right? So \"오천 원\" is 1,000 won. But in Korean, \"원\" is usually 1,000 won. So the amount is 1,000 won. The recipient is \"철수\" (Seo Young). The intent is transfer. So the response should be asking if they want to send 1,000 won to Seo Young. Let me check the example again. The example had \"삼만원\" which is 3,000, and the response was \"엄마님께 30,000원을 송금해드릴까요?\" So the response is a question asking if they want to proceed. So here, the response should be similar: \"철수님께 1,000원을 송금해드릴까요?\" But need to make sure the amount is correctly converted. Oh, wait, \"오천 원\" is 1,000 won, so the amount is 1000. So the response should be \"철수님께 1,000원을 송금해드릴까요?\" That's the correct format. The intent is transfer, amount is 1000, recipient is 철수, response is the question.\n</think>\n\n{ \"intent\": \"transfer\", \"amount\": 1000, \"recipient\": \"철수\", \"response\": \"철수님께 1,000원을 송금해드릴까요?\" }"

    "raw_output": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wrote \"엄마한테 3만원만\". So, they want to send 30,000 won to their mother. The intent here is definitely transfer. The amount is 3만원 which is 30,000, so amount is 30000. The recipient is \"엄마\" which is the mother. The response should be a natural Korean message asking if they want to send the money. So the response would be something like \"엄마님께 30,000원을 송금해드릴까요?\".\n\nWait, but the user wrote \"만\" which is \"only\" in Korean. So they might be saying \"only 30,000\" but in the example, they just said \"3만원만\" which is 30,000. So the amount is 30,000. The recipient is the mother. So the intent is transfer, amount is 30000, recipient is 엄마, response is the question. I think that's correct.\n</think>\n\n{ \"intent\": \"transfer\", \"amount\": 30000, \"recipient\": \"엄마\", \"response\": \"엄마님께 30,000원을 송금해드릴까요?\" }"

  {
    "text": "만원만 보내줘",
    "raw_output": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user said \"만원만 보내줘\". First, I need to determine the intent. The word \"보내줘\" means \"send\" or \"send to\", so the intent is likely transfer. The amount is \"만원\" which is 10,000 won. The recipient isn't mentioned, so it's null. The response should be a natural Korean reply asking if they want to send 10,000 won to someone. Let me check the example again. The example had \"엄마한테 삼만원 보내줘\" and the response was \"엄마님께 30,000원을 송금해드릴까요?\" So the response should be similar, asking if they want to send 10,000 won to the recipient. But since the recipient isn't specified, maybe just ask if they want to send 10,000 won. Wait, the user didn't mention a recipient, so the recipient is null. So the response should be \"10,000원을 보내드릴까요?\" or something like that. But the example had a question, so maybe \"10,000원을 보내드릴까요?\".\n</think>\n\n{ \"intent\": \"transfer\", \"amount\": 10000, \"recipient\": null, \"response\": \"10,000원을 보내드릴까요?\" }"

    "text": "엄마한테 보내줘",
    "raw_output": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wrote \"엄마한테 보내줘\". So, they want to send something to mom. The intent here is probably transfer, right? Because \"보내줘\" is a common way to send something. But I need to check if it's definitely transfer or if it's something else.\n\nThe amount isn't mentioned, so I should return null for that. The recipient is \"엄마\" which is mom, so recipient is \"엄마\". The response should be a natural Korean reply asking if they want to send the money. Like \"엄마님께 X원을 송금해드릴까요?\" but since the amount is unknown, maybe just \"엄마님께 송금해드릴까요?\".\n\nWait, the example given in the instructions had \"삼만원\" which is 30,000. But here, the user didn't specify an amount. So the amount is null. The intent is transfer. So the response should be a confirmation question. So the final answer would be intent: transfer, amount: null, recipient: 엄마, response: 엄마님께 송금해드릴까요?\n</think>\n\n{ \"intent\": \"transfer\", \"amount\": null, \"recipient\": \"엄마\", \"response\": \"엄마님께 송금해드릴까요?\" }"

    "raw_output": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wrote \"나 송금하고 싶어\". They want to transfer money. The intent here is definitely transfer. But wait, the sentence is short. Let me check the keywords. \"송금\" is the action of transferring money, and \"하고 싶어\" means \"want to do\". So the intent is transfer. \n\nAmount? The user didn't mention any specific amount. So amount is null. Recipient? They didn't specify who. So recipient is null. Response needs to be a natural Korean response. The example given was \"엄마님께 30,000원을 송금해드릴까요?\" So for this case, it should be something like \"계좌로 송금해드릴까요?\" or \"이름을 알려주시면 바로 처리해드릴게요?\" \n\nWait, but the user hasn't provided the recipient's name. So the response should ask for the recipient's name. So the response would be something like \"받는 사람의 이름을 알려주시면 바로 처리해드릴게요?\" or similar. \n\nSo putting it all together: intent is transfer, amount is null, recipient is null, response is a question asking for the recipient's name.\n</think>\n\n{ \"intent\": \"transfer\", \"amount\": null, \"recipient\": null, \"response\": \"받는 사람의 이름을 알려주시면 바로 처리해드릴게요?\" }"

    "raw_output": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking, \"가스비 내야 하는데 어떻게 해야 해?\" which translates to \"I need to pay the gas fee, how do I do that?\" So first, I need to determine the intent. The user is asking about paying a gas fee, which is a financial transaction. The intent here is likely \"transfer\" because they're asking about paying money. But wait, the user is asking \"how to do it,\" which might be a request for steps, but the main action is paying. However, the intent might be \"inquiry\" since they're seeking information on how to pay. But the example given in the instructions has \"transfer\" when the user asks to send money. So maybe the intent here is \"inquiry\" because they're asking for guidance on the process.\n\nNext, the amount. The user hasn't mentioned any specific amount, so the amount would be null.\n\nRecipient: The user hasn't specified a recipient, so recipient is null.\n\nResponse: The response should be a natural Korean response. The example for transfer was \"엄마님께 30,000원을 송금해드릴까요?\" So for this case, the response would be something like \"가스비를 납부하시려면 어떻게 해야 하나요?\" or \"가스비를 내려고 하시면 어떻게 해야 하나요?\" But since the user is asking how to do it, the response should guide them on the steps. However, the example for transfer was a question asking if they want to send money, so maybe here the response is a question asking how to pay the gas fee.\n\nWait, but the user is asking \"how to do it,\" which is a request for steps. But the intent might still be \"inquiry\" because they're seeking information. However, the example for \"transfer\" was a question about sending money, so maybe in this case, the intent is \"inquiry\" and the response is a question asking how to pay the gas fee.\n\nSo putting it all together: intent is \"inquiry\", amount is null, recipient is null, response is a question like \"가스비를 내려고 하시면 어떻게 해야 하나요?\" or similar.\n</think>\n\n{  \n  \"intent\": \"inquiry\",  \n  \"amount\": null,  \n  \"recipient\": null,  \n  \"response\": \"가스비를 내려고 하시면 어떻게 해야 하나요?\"  \n}"

    "raw_output": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking, \"내 계좌에 얼마 남았어?\" which translates to \"How much is left in my account?\" in Korean. \n\nFirst, I need to determine the intent. The user is asking about the balance in their account. The possible intents are transfer, confirm, cancel, inquiry, other, or system_response. Since they're asking about the balance, that's related to inquiry. So the intent should be \"inquiry\".\n\nNext, the amount. The user is asking how much is left, but they didn't specify a particular amount. So the amount would be null because there's no specific number mentioned.\n\nThe recipient is the user themselves, but the user is asking about their own account. The recipient would be \"내 계좌\" or \"자신\" but since the user is asking about their own account, the recipient is not a specific person. However, in the example, when the user says \"엄마한테 삼만원 보내줘\", the recipient is \"엄마\". But here, the user is asking about their own account, so the recipient is not a specific person. So the recipient should be null.\n\nThe response needs to be a natural Korean response. The user is asking for the balance, so the response should be something like \"계좌에 남은 금액을 알려드릴까요?\" or \"계좌 잔액은 어떻게 되나요?\".\n\nWait, but the example given in the instructions for the transfer intent had a response like \"엄마님께 30,000원을 송금해드릴까요?\" So for inquiry, the response would be similar. So the response would be \"계좌 잔액을 알려드릴까요?\" or \"계좌에 남은 금액은 어떻게 되나요?\"\n\nPutting it all together: intent is inquiry, amount is null, recipient is null, response is \"계좌 잔액을 알려드릴까요?\".\n</think>\n\n{ \"intent\": \"inquiry\", \"amount\": null, \"recipient\": null, \"response\": \"계좌 잔액을 알려드릴까요?\" }"

    "raw_output": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wrote \"그 사람한테 또 보내줘\". I need to analyze this sentence for intent, amount, recipient, and response.\n\nFirst, the intent. The user is talking about sending something to \"그 사람\" (that person) again. The word \"또\" means \"again\" or \"another time,\" so the intent here is likely to transfer money. The original example had \"보내줘\" which is \"send to,\" so this is a transfer intent.\n\nNext, the amount. The sentence doesn't mention any specific number. The example had 30000, but here there's no number. So the amount should be null.\n\nRecipient is \"그 사람\" which is the person mentioned. So recipient is \"그 사람\".\n\nResponse needs to be a natural Korean response. The example used \"엄마님께 30,000원을 송금해드릴까요?\" So for this case, it would be \"그 사람님께 [amount]원을 송금해드릴까요?\" But since the amount is null, it should be \"그 사람님께 송금해드릴까요?\".\n\nWait, but the user didn't specify the amount. So the response should just be asking if they want to send again. So the response would be \"그 사람님께 송금해드릴까요?\".\n\nPutting it all together: intent is transfer, amount is null, recipient is \"그 사람\", response is \"그 사람님께 송금해드릴까요?\".\n</think>\n\n{ \"intent\": \"transfer\", \"amount\": null, \"recipient\": \"그 사람\", \"response\": \"그 사람님께 송금해드릴까요?\" }"

    "text": "아까랑 똑같이 보내줘",
    "raw_output": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user said, \"아까랑 똑같이 보내줘\". So they want to send something the same way as before. First, I need to figure out the intent. The key here is \"보내줘\" which is \"send\" in Korean. The user is asking to send the same thing as before, so it's likely a transfer intent. But wait, the user didn't mention the amount or recipient. The previous message might have had those details, but in this case, the user is just saying \"same as before.\" So maybe the intent is confirm or other? But since they're asking to send the same, it's more like a transfer. But if there's no amount or recipient mentioned, maybe it's a confirm? Wait, the example given in the instructions has \"transfer\" when the user says \"send money to someone.\" Here, the user is saying \"same as before,\" which could mean they want to repeat a previous transfer. But without knowing the previous details, maybe it's a confirm? Or is it a system response? Hmm.\n\nWait, the user is asking to send the same as before. If the previous transfer was done, then this is a confirm. But if the user is just saying \"same way,\" maybe it's a system response. But the example shows that when the user says \"send to mom,\" the response is a question. Here, the user is not asking a question but stating a request. So maybe the intent is transfer, but the amount and recipient are not provided. But the example shows that if the amount is not given, it's null. So in this case, the user hasn't provided the amount or recipient, so the amount and recipient would be null. The response would be a confirmation like \"아까님께 같은 금액을 송금해드릴까요?\" But the user is just saying \"same as before,\" so maybe the response is a confirmation. But the intent is transfer. So the intent is transfer, amount is null, recipient is null, response is a confirmation. But the user might not have provided the details, so the system would need to ask for them. But according to the instructions, the response should be a natural Korean response. So maybe the response is \"아까님께 같은 금액을 송금해드릴까요?\" But since the user hasn't specified the amount or recipient, the response would be a question to confirm. But the user's message is a request to send the same as before, so the intent is transfer, but the amount and recipient are not provided. So the answer would be intent: transfer, amount: null, recipient: null, response: \"아까님께 같은 금액을 송금해드릴까요?\" But maybe the user is just saying \"same as before\" without any specific details, so the response is a confirmation. But I need to check the example again. In the example, when the user says \"send to mom,\" the response is a question. So here, the user is saying \"same as before,\" which is a request, so the response would be a question to confirm. So the intent is transfer, amount and recipient are null, response is a question. But the user might not have provided the details, so the system would need to ask for them. But according to the instructions, the response should be a natural Korean response. So the answer would be intent: transfer, amount: null, recipient: null, response: \"아까님께 같은 금액을 송금해드릴까요?\" But maybe the user is just saying \"same as before\" without any specific details, so the response is a confirmation. But the system might need to ask for the details. However, the user's message is a request, so the intent is transfer, and the response is a question to confirm.

The example given in the instructions had \"삼만원 보내줘\" which is \"send 30,000 won\" and the response was a confirmation. But here, the user just says \"송금할래\" which is \"I want to transfer money\" in Korean.\n\nSo, the intent should be \"transfer\" because they're asking to make a transfer. But the amount and recipient are missing. The amount is null because there's no number mentioned. The recipient is also null because the user didn't specify who. The response should be a confirmation question like \"송금을 진행해드릴까요?\" which is \"Will you proceed with the transfer?\".\n\nWait, but the user might be asking if they can transfer, but the original message is just a request. So the intent is transfer, amount is null, recipient is null, and the response is a confirmation question.

    "raw_output": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking \"이체 수수료 얼마야?\" which translates to \"What is the transfer fee?\" in Korean. So the intent here is probably about checking the transfer fee. The possible intents are transfer, confirm, cancel, inquiry, other, or system_response. Since the user is asking for the fee, that's an inquiry. \n\nThe amount is not mentioned, so it should be null. The recipient isn't specified either, so recipient is null. The response needs to be a natural Korean reply. The example given for transfer was a question asking to send the amount. So here, the response should be something like \"이체 수수료는 어떻게 되나요?\" or similar. \n\nWait, but the user is asking for the fee, so the response should be a question asking for the fee. The example in the instructions had \"엄마님께 30,000원을 송금해드릴까요?\" which was a confirmation. But here, the user is asking for the fee, so the response should be a question. So the response would be \"이체 수수료는 어떻게 되나요?\" or \"이체 수수료는 얼마인가요?\" \n\nBut the user is asking \"어차피 얼마야?\" which is \"What is the fee?\" so the response should be a question. So the intent is inquiry, amount is null, recipient is null, and the response is a question about the fee. \n\nI need to make sure that the intent is correctly classified as inquiry. The other options like transfer or confirm don't fit here. The user isn't asking to send money, they're asking for the fee. So the correct intent is inquiry.\n</think>\n\n{ \"intent\": \"inquiry\", \"amount\": null, \"recipient\": null, \"response\": \"이체 수수료는 어떻게 되나요?\" }"

    "raw_output": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user sent the message \"오늘 아빠랑 점심 먹었어\". I need to analyze this for intent, amount, recipient, and response.\n\nFirst, the intent. The user is talking about having lunch with their father. The keywords here are \"점심 먹었어\" which means they had lunch. The intent here is probably not transfer, confirm, cancel, inquiry, or system_response. It's a daily activity, so maybe \"other\"? But the example given had a transfer intent. Wait, the user is not making a request or asking for something. So maybe \"other\" because it's a normal statement, not a transaction.\n\nAmount: There's no mention of money or a specific amount. The user didn't say how much they spent or anything like that. So amount is null.\n\nRecipient: The user mentioned \"아빠\" which is \"father\" in Korean. So recipient is \"아빠\".\n\nResponse: The system needs to generate a natural Korean response. Since the user is just informing about lunch, the response should be a confirmation or a friendly reply. Maybe something like \"좋아요, 아빠와 점심을 먹었어요!\" or \"그렇다, 아빠와 점심을 먹었어!\".\n\nWait, but the example for transfer had a question. Here, since it's a normal statement, the response should be a confirmation. So the response would be a friendly acknowledgment. Let me check the example again. The example for \"엄마한테 삼만원 보내줘\" had a question. So maybe here, the response is a statement like \"아빠와 점심을 먹었어요!\" but the system needs to generate a natural response. Maybe \"좋아요, 아빠와 점심을 먹었어요!\" or \"그렇다, 아빠와 점심을 먹었어!\"\n\nSo putting it all together: intent is \"other\", amount is null, recipient is \"아빠\", response is a friendly acknowledgment.\n</think>\n\n{ \"intent\": \"other\", \"amount\": null, \"recipient\": \"아빠\", \"response\": \"아빠와 점심을 먹었어요!\" }"

The words \"보내줘\" indicate a transfer, so intent is transfer. The amount is \"이만원\", which is 50,000 won. The recipient is \"아빠\" or \"아빠한테\". The response should be a natural Korean confirmation. Let me check the example given. The example had \"엄마한테 삼만원 보내줘\" and the response was \"엄마님께 30,000원을 송금해드릴까요?\" So, similar structure. Here, the amount is 50,000, recipient is 아빠, so the response would be \"아빠님께 50,000원을 송금해드릴까요?\".\n</think>\n\n{ \"intent\": \"transfer\", \"amount\": 50000, \"recipient\": \"아빠\", \"response\": \"아빠님께 50,000원을 송금해드릴까요?\" }"

The key words here are \"이체해줘\" which means \"transfer\" in Korean. So the intent is definitely \"transfer\".\n\nNext, the amount. They mention \"십만 원\" which is 100,000 won. So the amount should be 100000. The recipient is \"여보\" which is \"you\" in Korean, but the user is addressing someone specifically. However, the example uses \"엄마\" (mother) and the response is about the recipient. Here, the user is addressing \"여보\" (you), so the recipient should be \"여보\".\n\nWait, but in the example, \"엄마\" is the recipient, and the response is about sending to that person. So here, the recipient is \"여보\", and the response should be asking if they want to transfer 100,000 won. The response should be in Korean, natural and friendly. So the response would be something like \"여보님께 100,000원을 이체해드릴까요?\".\n\nI need to make sure that the amount is correctly parsed as 100000, and the recipient is \"여보\". The intent is transfer, so no other categories apply. The response is a confirmation question. All the requirements are met here.\n</think>\n\n{ \"intent\": \"transfer\", \"amount\": 100000, \"recipient\": \"여보\", \"response\": \"여보님께 100,000원을 이체해드릴까요?\" }"

  {
    "text": "보내지 마",
    "raw_output": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wrote \"보내지 마\". So, they want to cancel a transfer. The intent here should be \"cancel\" because they're refusing to send the money. The amount isn't mentioned, so that's null. The recipient isn't specified either, so null. The response needs to be a natural Korean reply. Maybe something like \"송금을 취소해드릴까요?\" to confirm the cancellation. Let me check the rules again. Yep, intent is cancel, amount and recipient are null, response is a confirmation.

    "raw_output": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wrote \"그냥 넘어가줘\". I need to analyze this sentence and extract the intent, amount, recipient, and response as per the given guidelines.\n\nFirst, the intent. The user is asking to just go over, which is a bit vague. The possible intents are transfer, confirm, cancel, inquiry, other, or system_response. Since the user is not making a request to transfer money, confirm a transaction, cancel something, or inquire about something, this might fall under \"other\" or \"system_response\". But \"system_response\" is for when the system is asking for more info. Since the user is just saying \"just go over\", maybe it's not a request but a command. But the instructions say to return one of the intents. The closest might be \"other\" because it's a general statement.\n\nNext, the amount. The sentence doesn't mention any number, so amount is null.\n\nRecipient: There's no mention of a person's name, so recipient is null.\n\nResponse: The user is asking to just go over, so the response should be a natural Korean reply. Maybe something like \"알겠습니다. 지금 바로 넘어갑니다.\" or \"네, 지금 바로 넘어갑니다.\" But the example shows a more formal response. So maybe \"알겠습니다. 지금 바로 넘어갑니다.\" would be appropriate.\n\nWait, but the user's message is \"그냥 넘어가줘\" which is a direct command. The response should be a natural reply to that command. So the system should respond with a confirmation. So the response would be \"알겠습니다. 지금 바로 넘어갑니다.\" which is a natural Korean reply.\n\nSo putting it all together: intent is \"other\" because it's not a transaction request, amount is null, recipient is null, and the response is the confirmation.\n</think>\n\n{ \"intent\": \"other\", \"amount\": null, \"recipient\": null, \"response\": \"알겠습니다. 지금 바로 넘어갑니다.\" }"

    "raw_output": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user said \"엄마 송금해줘\". So, first, I need to determine the intent. The word \"송금\" means transferring money, so the intent is likely \"transfer\". The recipient is \"엄마\", which is \"mother\" in Korean. The amount isn't specified, so that's null. The response should be a natural Korean reply asking if they want to send the money. Let me check the example again. The example had \"엄마한테 삼만원 보내줘\" and the response was \"엄마님께 30,000원을 송금해드릴까요?\" So, following that structure, the response would be \"엄마님께 [amount]원을 송금해드릴까요?\" But since the amount is missing, I should leave it as null. So the final answer should have intent as transfer, recipient as 엄마, amount null, and response as the question asking to send the money.\n</think>\n\n{ \"intent\": \"transfer\", \"amount\": null, \"recipient\": \"엄마\", \"response\": \"엄마님께 송금해드릴까요?\" }"

So the intent is likely \"transfer\".\n\nNext, the amount is \"삼만원\" which is 30,000. So the amount should be 30000. The recipient isn't mentioned directly, but the user is talking about sending it to someone. However, in the example, when the user said \"엄마한테 삼만원 보내줘\", the recipient was \"엄마\". But here, the user is just saying \"보내는 거였지\" without specifying who. Wait, maybe the recipient is implied? But the example shows that if the recipient isn't mentioned, it's null. So in this case, since the user didn't mention the recipient, it should be null.\n\nFor the response, the system needs to ask if they want to send 30,000 to someone. The example response was \"엄마님께 30,000원을 송금해드릴까요?\" So the response should be similar, asking for confirmation. But since the recipient isn't specified, maybe the response is \"30,000원을 송금해드릴까요?\" without mentioning the recipient. But the example includes the recipient. Wait, in the example, the user said \"엄마한테 삼만원 보내줘\" and the response was about sending to grandma. But in this case, the user is just saying \"보내는 거였지\" which is a bit vague. So maybe the response should be a general confirmation. But the example shows that even if the recipient isn't specified, the response includes the recipient. Hmm, maybe the recipient is not specified here, so the response should be a general question. But the example has the recipient. Wait, the user's message is \"아, 삼만원 보내는 거였지\" which is a bit unclear. The user might be confirming that they sent 30,000, but the recipient isn't mentioned. So the response should be a confirmation question, but without the recipient. So the response would be \"30,000원을 송금해드릴까요?\".\n\nPutting it all together: intent is transfer, amount is 30000, recipient is null, response is \"30,000원을 송금해드릴까요?\".\n</think>\n\n{  \n  \"intent\": \"transfer\",  \n  \"amount\": 30000,  \n  \"recipient\": null,  \n  \"response\": \"30,000원을 송금해드릴까요?\"  \n}"
  },
  {
    "text": "예금해줘",
    "raw_output": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wrote \"예금해줘\". The intent here is to deposit money, right? So the intent should be \"transfer\" because they're asking to deposit funds. But wait, the user didn't mention the amount or the recipient. The amount is required, but since they didn't specify, I should return null for that. Similarly, the recipient isn't mentioned, so null there. The response needs to be a natural Korean reply. The example given was \"엄마님께 30,000원을 송금해드릴까요?\" which is a confirmation. But here, the user is asking to deposit, so maybe the response should be something like \"예금을 처리해드릴까요?\" or \"예금을 하시겠어요?\".\n\nWait, but the user didn't specify the amount or recipient. So the response should be a general confirmation. Let me check the instructions again. The response should be a natural Korean guide. So maybe \"예금을 처리해드릴까요?\" or \"예금을 하시겠어요?\" But the example had a specific amount and recipient, but in this case, since they didn't provide those, the response should be more general. So the intent is transfer, amount is null, recipient is null, and the response is a confirmation. Yeah, that makes sense.\n</think>\n\n{ \"intent\": \"transfer\", \"amount\": null, \"recipient\": null, \"response\": \"예금을 처리해드릴까요?\" }"
  },
  {
    "text": "누구한테 보낼까요?",
    "raw_output": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking \"누구한테 보낼까요?\" which translates to \"Who should I send it to?\" in English. The intent here is to determine the recipient of a transfer. But the user hasn't specified who yet. The previous message was the user asking who to send it to, and the assistant hasn't provided a response yet. So, the intent would be 'inquiry' because the user is asking for information about the recipient. The amount is not mentioned, so it's null. The recipient is not specified, so it's null. The response should be a natural Korean response asking the user to specify the recipient. So, the response would be something like \"받으시는 분을 알려주세요.\" That makes sense.\n</think>\n\n{ \"intent\": \"inquiry\", \"amount\": null, \"recipient\": null, \"response\": \"받으시는 분을 알려주세요.\" }"
