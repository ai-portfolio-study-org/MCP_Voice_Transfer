The recipient is \"철수\" or \"철수한테\" but the name is \"철수\", so recipient is \"철수\".\n\nThe response should be a natural way to ask confirmation. The example given was \"엄마님께 30,000원을 송금하시겠어요?\" So similar structure. Here, it would be \"철수님께 100,000원을 송금하시겠어요?\".\n\nCheck if any other conditions apply.

So the amount is 30000.\n\nThe recipient is \"엄마\" which is their mother. So recipient is \"엄마\".\n\nThe response should be a natural question to confirm the transfer.

    "raw_output": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user said \"만원만 보내줘\". First, I need to determine the intent. The word \"보내줘\" is a common way to ask to send money in Korean. So the intent is likely \"transfer\".\n\nNext, the amount. The user said \"만원\" which is \"10,000 won\". But wait, in Korean, \"만원\" is 10,000, but sometimes people might say \"만원\" as in \"10,000 won\" or \"10,000원\". So the amount should be 10,000. But the user might be using \"만원\" as a unit, so the amount is 10,000.\n\nRecipient: The user didn't mention anyone specifically. So recipient is null.\n\nResponse: The response should be a natural language confirmation. Like \"10,000 won을 보내시겠어요?\" or \"만원만 보내시겠어요?\"\n\nWait, the example given in the instructions had \"엄마님께 30,000원을 송금하시겠어요?\" So the response is a question asking if they want to send the amount. So for this case, the response should be similar: \"10,000 won을 보내시겠어요?\"\n\nBut the user's message is \"만원만 보내줘\" which is \"send only 10,000 won\". So the response should be a confirmation. So the JSON would be:\n\n{\n  \"intent\": \"transfer\",\n  \"amount\": 10000,\n  \"recipient\": null,\n  \"response\": \"10,000 won을 보내시겠어요?\"\n}\n\nBut wait, the user might be asking to send 10,000 won, so the response should be a question asking if they want to send that amount.

But wait, the user didn't mention an amount or a recipient name. The recipient is \"엄마\" which is Mom, so that's the recipient. But the amount isn't specified. The example given in the instructions has amount as 30000, but here there's no number. So according to the conditions, if the intent is transfer, then amount should be null if it's not provided. The user just said \"보내줘\" which is \"send\", not specifying the amount. So the amount should be null. The response would be a natural language confirmation, like \"Mom, 30,000원을 송금하시겠어요?\" but since the amount isn't given, maybe just \"엄마님께 송금하시겠어요?\".\n\nWait, but the user didn't mention the amount. So the amount is null. The recipient is \"엄마\". So the JSON should have intent as transfer, recipient as \"엄마\", and response as a confirmation without the amount. Let me check the example again. The example had \"엄마\" as recipient and \"30,000원\" as amount. But in this case, since there's no amount, it's null.

But wait, the user hasn't specified the amount or the recipient yet. The example shows that if the user mentions the amount and recipient, they are extracted. But in this case, the user just says they want to transfer, no numbers or names. So according to the conditions, amount and recipient should be null.

The user's question is \"가스비 내야 하는데 어떻게 해야 해?\" which translates to \"I need to pay the gas bill, how do I do that?\" \n\nFirst, I need to determine the intent. The user is asking about paying a gas bill, so the intent should be \"transfer\" or \"inquiry\". Wait, the possible intents are transfer, confirm, cancel, inquiry, other, system_response. Since the user is asking how to pay, it's more of an inquiry, but maybe they want to confirm if they need to pay. However, the user hasn't mentioned a specific amount or recipient yet. \n\nLooking at the conditions: if the intent is transfer, then amount and recipient are extracted. But the user hasn't mentioned any amount or recipient. So the intent here is probably \"inquiry\" because they're asking for information on how to pay. But the example given in the instructions had \"transfer\" as the intent when there was an amount and recipient. \n\nWait, the user's question is about paying the gas bill, which is a service, not a transfer. So maybe the intent is \"inquiry\" because they're seeking information on how to proceed. However, the system_response would be a natural language response. \n\nBut according to the conditions, if the intent is not transfer, then amount and recipient are null. So in this case, the intent would be \"inquiry\", and the response would be a message like \"가스비를 내야 하는데, 어떻게 해야 하나요? 일반적으로 가스비는 월별로 납부해야 하며, 전기사에 문의하시면 안내를 받으시면 됩니다.\" \n\nBut the user might be expecting a transfer action, but since they're asking how to pay, it's an inquiry.

I need to determine the intent, amount, recipient, and response based on the given conditions.\n\nFirst, the intent. The user is asking about the balance in their account, which is related to a transfer or checking the balance. But the instructions say that for the intent, it should be one of transfer, confirm, cancel, inquiry, other, or system_response. Since the user is asking about the balance, that's more like an inquiry. However, the example given for inquiry is when they ask about the recipient's name. But here, it's about the balance. So maybe the intent is \"inquiry\".\n\nNext, the amount. The user is asking how much is left, but they didn't specify a particular amount. So the amount should be null.\n\nRecipient: The user is asking about their own account, so there's no recipient mentioned. So recipient is null.\n\nResponse: The response should be a natural language confirmation. For example, \"계좌에 현재 잔액은 X원입니다.\" But since the user is asking for the balance, the response should be something like \"계좌에 현재 잔액은 X원 남아 있습니다.\" But the example given in the instructions for inquiry is when they ask about the recipient's name, so maybe the response here would be similar to that.\n\nWait, but the user is asking about their own account balance, which is an inquiry. So the intent is \"inquiry\", not \"transfer\". But the example given in the instructions for \"inquiry\" is when the user asks about the recipient's name. So maybe the intent here is \"inquiry\".\n\nSo putting it all together, the JSON would be:\n\n{\n  \"intent\": \"inquiry\",\n  \"amount\": null,\n  \"recipient\": null,\n  \"response\": \"계좌에 현재 잔액은 X원입니다.\"\n}\n\nBut wait, the user's question is \"내 계좌에 얼마 남았어?\" which is \"How much is left in my account?\" So the response should be about the balance. However, the system_response in the example is for when the user asks about the recipient's name. So maybe the intent here is \"inquiry\" and the response is about the balance. But according to the conditions, the amount is only extracted if the intent is transfer. Since the intent here is inquiry, amount and recipient are null. The response should be a natural language answer about the balance.\n\nSo the final JSON should have intent as \"inquiry\", amount and recipient as null, and the response as a message about the balance.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"intent\": \"inquiry\",\n  \"amount\": null,\n  \"recipient\": null,\n  \"response\": \"계좌에 현재 잔액은 X원입니다.\"\n}"

So the intent here is probably a transfer, but the user is asking to send again. But the original query doesn't mention a specific amount or recipient. The user just says \"another time\" or \"again\". \n\nWait, the conditions say that if the intent is transfer, then amount and recipient are extracted. But in this case, the user isn't specifying the amount or recipient. They just want to send to the same person again. But the original message doesn't have any details. So maybe the intent is \"other\" because there's no specific transfer request. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user is confirming a transfer, but the message is just a request to send again. But without the amount or recipient, it's not a valid transfer. So the intent would be \"other\" since there's no clear transfer intent. The amount and recipient are null. The response would be a natural language response like \"그 사람에게 다시 보내시겠어요?\" but since the intent is other, maybe just a confirmation. Wait, but the example shows that when the intent is transfer, the response is a question. If the intent is other, maybe the response is a statement. But the user's message is a request, so maybe the response is \"그 사람에게 다시 보내시겠어요?\" but the intent is other. \n\nWait, the user's message is \"그 사람한테 또 보내줘\" which is a request to send again.

Since they're talking about sending money, the intent is likely \"transfer\". \n\nNow, the amount and recipient. The user didn't specify any particular amount or recipient, just said \"아까랑 똑같이\". So, if \"아까\" refers to a previous transfer, then the amount and recipient would be the same as the previous one. But since there's no previous context provided, maybe the user is just saying they want to send the same amount and recipient as before. However, without knowing the previous details, I can't extract specific values. \n\nWait, the conditions say that if the intent is transfer, then amount and recipient are extracted. But if there's no specific info, maybe they are null. But the user is asking to send the same as before, which implies that the amount and recipient are the same as previous. But since the previous details aren't provided here, maybe the system can't know. However, the example shows that when the user says \"아까랑 똑같이\", the response is \"엄마님께 30,000원을 송금하시겠어요?\" which implies that the amount is 30,000 and recipient is 엄마. But in this case, the user hasn't provided any specific amount or recipient, so maybe the system is expecting to use the same values as before. But since there's no previous data, perhaps the answer should be that the amount and recipient are null. \n\nWait, but the user is asking to send the same as before, so maybe the system is supposed to assume that the previous transfer had certain values. However, without that information, the assistant can't know. So, in this case, since the user hasn't provided specific details, the amount and recipient would be null. But the example shows that even without specific info, the assistant can generate a response. Hmm, but according to the conditions, only when the intent is transfer, amount and recipient are extracted. If the user is just saying \"send the same as before\", but there's no previous data, then the amount and recipient would be null. \n\nSo the JSON would be intent: transfer, amount: null, recipient: null, response: \"아까랑 똑같이 보내시겠어요?\" But the example shows that when the user says \"아까랑 똑같이\", the response is a question about sending to the same recipient. But in this case, since the user hasn't provided specific details, the response would be a general confirmation. However, the example's response is a question, but in this case, the user is just saying to send the same as before, so the response would be a confirmation. \n\nBut the problem is that the user hasn't provided any specific amount or recipient, so the assistant can't extract them. Therefore, the correct JSON would have amount and recipient as null, and the response as a general confirmation.

    "raw_output": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user said, \"아, 삼만원 보내는 거였지.\" So they're talking about sending 30,000 won. The intent here is definitely transfer. The amount is 30,000, and the recipient isn't mentioned, so that's null. The response should be a natural question like \"30,000원을 송금하시겠어요?\" So the JSON should have intent as transfer, amount as 30000, recipient as null, and the response as the question.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"intent\": \"transfer\",\n  \"amount\": 30000,\n  \"recipient\": null,\n  \"response\": \"30,000원을 송금하시겠어요?\"\n}"

    "text": "예금해줘",
    "raw_output": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user said \"예금해줘\" which means \"deposit\" in Korean. But the intent here is to request a deposit, not a transfer. Transfer is when you send money, while deposit is adding money to your account. So the intent should be \"inquiry\" because they're asking to deposit, which is a type of account operation. Wait, but the conditions say that if the intent is transfer, then amount and recipient are extracted. Since this is a deposit, the intent isn't transfer. So the intent would be \"inquiry\" or \"other\"? The possible intents are transfer, confirm, cancel, inquiry, other, system_response. Since it's a deposit request, it's not a transfer, so maybe \"inquiry\" or \"other\". But \"inquiry\" is for asking information, while \"other\" is for other purposes. Since the user is asking to deposit, which is a transaction, but not a transfer, maybe \"other\"? But the example given in the instructions has \"inquiry\" for a deposit. Wait, the example was for a transfer, and the response was a confirmation. But in this case, the user is asking to deposit, which is a different action. So maybe the intent is \"inquiry\" because they're asking to add money, which is a type of account operation. But I need to check the conditions again. The conditions say that if the intent is transfer, then amount and recipient are extracted. Otherwise, they are null. So if the intent is not transfer, then amount and recipient are null. So in this case, the user is asking to deposit, which is a deposit, not a transfer. So the intent would be \"inquiry\" or \"other\". But the possible intents include \"inquiry\" and \"other\". Since the user is making a deposit request, which is a transaction, but not a transfer, maybe \"inquiry\" is the correct intent. However, the example given in the instructions had \"transfer\" as the intent. So maybe \"inquiry\" is the correct choice here. But I need to make sure. Alternatively, if the system_response is needed, but the user is asking to deposit, which is a transaction, but not a transfer. So the intent would be \"inquiry\" or \"other\". But the user is not asking for a confirmation or cancellation, just a deposit. So maybe \"inquiry\" is the correct intent. Therefore, the JSON would have intent as \"inquiry\", amount and recipient as null, and the response would be something like \"예금을 처리하시겠어요?\".\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"intent\": \"inquiry\",\n  \"amount\": null,\n  \"recipient\": null,\n  \"response\": \"예금을 처리하시겠어요?\"\n}"

    "raw_output": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking, \"누구한테 보낼까요?\" which means \"To whom do I send it?\" in Korean. They're asking about the recipient of a transfer. \n\nFirst, I need to determine the intent. The user hasn't mentioned any specific recipient or amount yet. The intent here is likely \"inquiry\" because they're asking for information about who to send the money to. \n\nThe conditions say that if the intent is transfer, then amount and recipient should be extracted.
