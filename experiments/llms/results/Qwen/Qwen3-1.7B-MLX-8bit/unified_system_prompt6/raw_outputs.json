    "text": "철수한테 오천 원 보내줘",
    "raw_output": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user says \"철수한테 오천 원 보내줘\". So they want to send 100,000 won to Jeongso. First, I need to determine the intent. The keywords are \"보내줘\" which is \"send\" and \"철수한테\" which is \"to Jeongso\". So the intent is transfer. \n\nNext, the recipient is \"철수\" without the title, so that's correct. The amount is \"오천 원\" which is 10,000 won. Wait, \"오천\" is 1,000, so the amount should be 10,000. But the user wrote \"오천 원\" which is 1,000 원. Wait, maybe there's a confusion here. Let me check. \"오천\" is 1,000, so \"오천 원\" is 1,000 원. But the user might have meant 10,000. Wait, no, the user wrote \"오천 원\" which is 1,000 원. But in the example given, when the user says \"삼만원 보내줘\" it's 30,000. So here, \"오천 원\" is 1,000 원. But maybe the user intended 10,000? Wait, no, the user wrote \"오천 원\" which is 1,000. So the amount should be 1,000. But maybe there's a typo. However, according to the user's exact input, it's \"오천 원\" which is 1,000. So the amount is 1,000.\n\nWait, but in the example, when the user says \"삼만원 보내줘\" it's 30,000. So \"삼만원\" is 3,000. So \"오천 원\" is 1,000. So the amount is 1,000. So the correct amount is 1,000. But maybe the user meant 10,000? No, the user wrote \"오천 원\" which is 1,000. So the amount is 1,000. \n\nSo the intent is transfer, recipient is 철수, amount is 1000, response should be \"철수님께 1,000원을 송금해드릴까요?\".\n\nWait, but the user wrote \"오천 원\" which is 1,000. So the amount is 1,000. So the JSON should have amount as 1000. But in the example, when the user says \"삼만원 보내줘\" it's 30000. So the amount is 30000. So here, \"오천 원\" is 1000. So the amount is 1000. \n\nSo the final JSON would be:\n\n{\n  \"intent\": \"transfer\",\n  \"amount\": 1000,\n  \"recipient\": \"철수\",\n  \"response\": \"철수님께 1,000원을 송금해드릴까요?\"\n}\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"intent\": \"transfer\",\n  \"amount\": 1000,\n  \"recipient\": \"철수\",\n  \"response\": \"철수님께 1,000원을 송금해드릴까요?\"\n}"

    "raw_output": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user said \"엄마한테 3만원만\". So, they want to send 30,000 won to their mother. The intent here is transfer, right? Because they're asking to send money. The recipient is \"엄마\" and the amount is 30000. The response should be a confirmation. The example given for \"transfer\" is like \"엄마님께 30,000원을 송금해드릴까요?\" So I need to follow that structure. Let me make sure there's no other intent. The user didn't ask to confirm anything or cancel. So the intent is transfer, amount is 30000, recipient is 엄마, response is the confirmation message.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"intent\": \"transfer\",\n  \"amount\": 30000,\n  \"recipient\": \"엄마\",\n  \"response\": \"엄마님께 30,000원을 송금해드릴까요?\"\n}"

    "raw_output": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user said \"만원만 보내줘\". First, I need to determine the intent. The word \"보내줘\" is a request to send, so the intent is likely transfer. The amount is \"만원\" which is 10,000 won. The recipient isn't mentioned, so it's null. The response should be a confirmation. The example given for \"삼만원 보내줘\" uses \"송금해드릴까요?\" so maybe here it's \"10,000원 송금해드릴까요?\" But need to check if the user wants to confirm or just send. Since the user said \"보내줘\" directly, it's a request, so the response should be a confirmation. So the JSON would have intent transfer, amount 10000, recipient null, response as the confirmation.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"intent\": \"transfer\",\n  \"amount\": 10000,\n  \"recipient\": null,\n  \"response\": \"10,000원 송금해드릴까요?\"\n}"

    "raw_output": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user said \"엄마한테 보내줘\". First, I need to determine the intent. The words \"보내줘\" are similar to \"보내기\" which is a common way to request a transfer. So the intent is likely transfer.\n\nNext, the recipient is \"엄마\" which is \"mother\" in Korean, so the recipient is \"엄마\".\n\nThe amount is not specified. The user didn't mention any number, so amount is null.\n\nThe response should be a natural Korean reply. Since it's a transfer request, the response should confirm the transfer. The example given for \"삼만원 보내줘\" uses \"30,000원 송금해드릴까요?\" so similar structure. So the response would be \"엄마님께 10,000원을 송금해드릴까요?\" but since the amount isn't specified, maybe just \"엄마님께 송금해드릴까요?\" but the example uses a number. Wait, the user didn't specify the amount, so maybe just confirm the recipient. But the example in the instructions for \"삼만원 보내줘\" has the amount. However, in this case, the user didn't mention the amount, so the response should be a confirmation of the recipient. So the response would be \"엄마님께 송금해드릴까요?\" but maybe the example uses a number. Wait, the user's message is \"엄마한테 보내줘\" which is \"send to mother\" without any amount. So the amount is null. So the response should be \"엄마님께 송금해드릴까요?\" but the example for \"삼만원 보내줘\" has the amount. But in this case, since the amount isn't specified, the response is just the confirmation. So the JSON would be intent: transfer, recipient: 엄마, amount: null, response: \"엄마님께 송금해드릴까요?\"\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"intent\": \"transfer\",\n  \"amount\": null,\n  \"recipient\": \"엄마\",\n  \"response\": \"엄마님께 송금해드릴까요?\"\n}"

    "raw_output": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user said, \"나 송금하고 싶어.\" Translating that, it's \"I want to transfer.\" So the intent here is definitely transfer. Now, the amount and recipient are important. The user didn't mention any specific amount or recipient name. The sentence is just \"I want to transfer,\" so both amount and recipient are null. The response should be a confirmation. The example given for transfer is \"송금해드릴까요?\" which is \"Will you receive the transfer?\" So I should respond with a similar confirmation. Let me make sure there's no other intent. The user isn't asking to confirm something else, just expressing a desire to transfer. So the JSON should have intent as transfer, amount and recipient as null, and the response in Korean.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"intent\": \"transfer\",\n  \"amount\": null,\n  \"recipient\": null,\n  \"response\": \"송금을 원하시면 언제든지 알려주세요!\"\n}"

    "raw_output": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking, \"가스비 내야 하는데 어떻게 해야 해?\" which translates to \"I need to pay the gas fee, how do I do that?\" \n\nFirst, I need to determine the intent. The user is asking about paying a gas fee, so the intent is likely \"transfer\" since they're asking about sending money. But wait, \"가스비\" is a gas fee, which might be a service fee or a payment for a service. However, the user is asking how to pay it, which could be a transfer. But maybe it's a different context. \n\nLooking at the example, when the user says \"삼만원 보내줘\" (send 30,000), the intent is transfer. So here, the user is asking how to pay the gas fee, which is a transfer. So intent is transfer.\n\nNext, the recipient. The user didn't mention a specific person, so recipient is null.\n\nAmount: The user didn't specify an amount, so amount is null.\n\nResponse: The user is asking how to pay the gas fee. The response should be a natural Korean answer. So something like \"가스비를 내려고 하시면, [이름]님께 송금해드릴까요?\" but since recipient is null, maybe \"가스비를 내려고 하시면, 송금해드릴까요?\" \n\nWait, but the user is asking how to pay it, not confirming. So the response should be a guide on how to pay. So maybe \"가스비를 내려고 하시면, [이름]님께 송금해드릴까요?\" but since recipient is null, maybe just \"가스비를 내려고 하시면, 송금해드릴까요?\" \n\nBut the example for \"confirm\" has a response like \"30,000원 송금 요청으로 확인했습니다.\" So for \"transfer\", the response should be a confirmation. But the user is asking how to do it, so maybe a guide. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user is asking for steps, but the system response should be a natural answer. So the response would be \"가스비를 내려고 하시면, [이름]님께 송금해드릴까요?\" with recipient as null. \n\nBut the user didn't mention a recipient, so recipient is null. So the final JSON would be intent: transfer, amount: null, recipient: null, response: \"가스비를 내려고 하시면, 송금해드릴까요?\"\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"intent\": \"transfer\",\n  \"amount\": null,\n  \"recipient\": null,\n  \"response\": \"가스비를 내려고 하시면, 송금해드릴까요?\"\n}"

    "raw_output": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking, \"내 계좌에 얼마 남았어?\" which translates to \"How much is left in my account?\" in Korean.\n\nFirst, I need to determine the intent. The user is asking about the balance in their account. The possible intents are transfer, confirm, cancel, inquiry, etc. Since they're asking about the balance, that's an inquiry. So intent should be \"inquiry\".\n\nNext, the recipient. The user is referring to their own account, so the recipient is \"내 계좌\" but the instruction says to extract the name without the title. However, the user didn't specify a person's name, just \"내 계좌\" which is \"my account\". So recipient would be null because there's no specific person mentioned.\n\nAmount is not mentioned, so it's null.\n\nResponse needs to be a natural Korean response. Since it's an inquiry about the balance, the response should be something like \"계좌 잔액을 알려드릴게요.\" or similar. But the example for inquiry is \"정보 확인 요청\" which is \"information confirmation request\". So the response should be a confirmation that they'll provide the balance.\n\nWait, the example for inquiry is \"정보 확인 요청\" which is \"information confirmation request\". But the user is asking for the balance, so the response should be a confirmation that the balance will be provided. So the response would be \"계좌 잔액을 알려드릴게요.\" or \"계좌의 현재 잔액을 확인해드릴게요.\"\n\nBut the user's question is in Korean, so the response should be in Korean. The example given for inquiry is \"정보 확인 요청\" but the response is \"정보 확인 요청을 처리해드릴게요.\" So maybe the response is \"계좌 잔액을 알려드릴게요.\" or similar.\n\nSo putting it all together, the JSON should have intent as \"inquiry\", recipient as null, amount as null, and response as a confirmation that the balance will be provided.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"intent\": \"inquiry\",\n  \"recipient\": null,\n  \"amount\": null,\n  \"response\": \"계좌 잔액을 알려드릴게요.\"\n}"

    "raw_output": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user said \"그 사람한테 또 보내줘\". First, I need to determine the intent. The words \"보내줘\" mean \"send it\", so the intent is likely transfer. But the user says \"또\", which is \"again\" or \"another\". So they want to send something to the same person again.\n\nLooking at the recipient, the user mentions \"그 사람\" which is \"that person\", so the recipient is \"그 사람\". The amount isn't specified, so it's null. The response should be a confirmation that they want to send again. The example for confirm is \"30,000원 송금 요청으로 확인했습니다.\" So here, since it's a confirm, the response would be something like \"그 사람님께 다시 10,000원을 송금해드릴까요?\" but since the amount isn't specified, maybe just \"그 사람님께 다시 송금해드릴까요?\".\n\nWait, but the user didn't mention an amount. So the amount is null. So the intent is confirm, recipient is \"그 사람\", amount is null. The response should be a confirmation.

But the user is saying \"아까랑 똑같이\", which means \"like last time\". So they want to send the same amount and recipient as before.\n\nBut wait, the user hasn't mentioned the recipient or amount explicitly. The previous conversation might have had a transfer, but since the current message is just \"보내줘\", maybe they're asking to send the same thing again. However, the user hasn't provided the recipient or amount in this message. So according to the rules, for transfer intent, I need to extract recipient and amount if they are present. But in this case, the user hasn't specified them. So recipient and amount would be null. The intent is transfer, and the response would be confirming the same as before. But since the user hasn't provided the details, maybe the response is a general confirmation. Wait, the example shows that if the user says \"삼만원 보내는 거였지\", the response is \"30,000원 송금 요청으로 확인했습니다.\" So here, the user is confirming a previous transfer. But in this case, the user is saying \"아까랑 똑같이 보내줘\", which is similar to \"send like last time\". So maybe the intent is confirm, but the user hasn't provided the details. Hmm, but the intent is transfer, and the user is asking to send the same as before. But since the user hasn't specified the recipient or amount, the response would be a confirmation that they want to send the same. But according to the rules, if the intent is transfer, then recipient and amount must be present. Since they aren't, they are null. So the intent is transfer, recipient and amount are null, and the response is a confirmation that they want to send the same as before. But the user hasn't provided the details, so the response would be something like \"요청하신 송금을 확인해드릴게요.\" But the example for confirm is when the user says \"삼만원 보내는 거였지\", which is a confirmation. So maybe the intent here is confirm, but the user hasn't provided the details. Wait, the user is asking to send the same as before, but without specifying the details. So maybe the intent is confirm, but the amount and recipient are not provided. But according to the rules, for confirm intent, the user must have provided the details. Wait, the intent is confirm, which is for confirming a previous transaction. But if the user hasn't provided the details, maybe the intent is other. But the user is asking to send the same as before, which is a transfer. So maybe the intent is transfer, but the recipient and amount are not provided. So the response would be a confirmation that they want to send the same. But the user hasn't specified the details, so the response would be something like \"요청하신 송금을 확인해드릴게요.\" But according to the rules, if the intent is transfer, then recipient and amount must be present. Since they are not, they are null. So the final answer would be intent: transfer, recipient: null, amount: null, response: \"요청하신 송금을 확인해드릴게요.\"\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"intent\": \"transfer\",\n  \"recipient\": null,\n  \"amount\": null,\n  \"response\": \"요청하신 송금을 확인해드릴게요.\"\n}"

But as an AI, I can't perform actual transfers. So the intent might be confirm, but the user is asking if I can do it. Alternatively, maybe it's a request to transfer. But the user hasn't provided the recipient or amount yet. So the intent could be inquiry because they're asking if I can transfer. But the example shows that when someone asks to transfer, the intent is transfer. Wait, the user's message is \"송금할래\" which is a question, but maybe they are asking if I can transfer. But according to the instructions, the intent should be one of the listed options. The user is asking if I can perform a transfer, so the intent might be inquiry. But the example shows that when someone says \"보내지 마\" (cancel), the intent is cancel. So in this case, the user is asking if I can transfer, so the intent is inquiry. But the user hasn't provided the recipient or amount, so recipient and amount are null. The response should be a confirmation that I can assist with transferring, but since the user hasn't specified details, the response would be a general inquiry.

    "raw_output": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking \"이체 수수료 얼마야?\" which translates to \"What is the transfer fee?\" in Korean.\n\nFirst, I need to determine the intent. The user is asking about a fee, so that's likely related to a transfer. The intent here is \"inquiry\" because they're asking for information. But wait, the options include \"inquiry\" as one of the intents. So the intent would be \"inquiry\".\n\nNext, the recipient. The user didn't mention a specific person, so recipient is null.\n\nAmount is also null because they're asking about the fee, not a specific amount.\n\nResponse needs to be a natural Korean response. Since it's an inquiry, the system should explain the transfer fee. The response should be something like \"이체 수수료는 일반적으로 1,000 원입니다. 자세한 내용은 고객센터로 문의하시기 바랍니다.\" But I need to make sure it's concise and in Korean.\n\nWait, the example for \"inquiry\" in the sample shows \"정보 확인 요청\" as the intent, and the response is a confirmation. So for this case, the response should be informative about the fee. So the response would be something like \"이체 수수료는 일반적으로 1,000 원입니다. 자세한 내용은 고객센터로 문의하시기 바랍니다.\" But I need to check if the user is asking for the fee, so the response should explain the fee and suggest contacting customer service for more info.\n\nSo the final JSON would have intent as \"inquiry\", recipient as null, amount as null, and the response in Korean explaining the fee.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"intent\": \"inquiry\",\n  \"recipient\": null,\n  \"amount\": null,\n  \"response\": \"이체 수수료는 일반적으로 1,000 원입니다. 자세한 내용은 고객센터로 문의하시기 바랍니다.\"\n}"

The intent here is probably about a daily activity, not a transfer, confirm, cancel, or inquiry. The keywords are \"점심 먹었어\" which means had lunch. There's no mention of sending money, confirming a previous action, canceling something, or asking for information. So the intent should be \"other\" because it's a regular conversation about eating out. The recipient is the father, but since they didn't specify a name, it's \"아빠\" but the example shows \"아빠\" as the recipient. The amount is not mentioned, so null.

The words \"보내줘\" are a common way to request a transfer in Korean, so the intent is likely \"transfer\".\n\nNext, the recipient is \"아빠\" which is \"dad\" in Korean, so the recipient is \"아빠\". The amount is \"이만원\" which is \"this amount\" or \"this many yuan\". But in Korean, \"이만원\" is used to indicate a specific amount, so \"이만원\" here would be 50000원?

Wait, but in the example given, when the user says \"삼만원 보내줘\", it's 30000. So here, \"이만원\" might be a way to say \"this amount\" but the actual number isn't given. Wait, but maybe the user is trying to say \"50,000원\" but wrote \"이만원\" which is \"this amount\". Hmm, but the user might have intended to say \"50,000원\" but wrote \"이만원\" as a way to indicate the amount. However, in the example, when the user says \"삼만원 보내줘\", it's 30000. So maybe \"이만원\" here is 50000? But the user might not have specified the exact number. Wait, but the user wrote \"이만원\" which is \"this amount\" but the actual number isn't given. So maybe the amount is not specified, so it should be null. Wait, but in the example, when the user says \"삼만원 보내줘\", the amount is 30000. So here, \"이만원\" is similar. But the user might have intended to say \"50,000원\" but wrote \"이만원\" as a way to indicate the amount. However, without a specific number, it's unclear. So maybe the amount is null.

So the amount should be null. Therefore, the response would be asking to send 50,000원, but since the amount is not specified, the system might need to ask for clarification. But according to the instructions, if the amount is not specified, it's null. So the response would be \"아빠님께 50,000원을 송금해드릴까요?\" but the amount is null.

So the intent is likely \"transfer\".\n\nNext, the recipient is \"여보\" which is \"you\" in Korean, but the user might be addressing someone else. However, the recipient is usually the person receiving the transfer. Since the user is asking to transfer to \"여보\", that's the recipient. But I need to check if \"여보\" is a proper name. If it's a nickname or a name, but the user didn't specify, I'll take it as is. So recipient is \"여보\".\n\nThe amount is \"십만 원\" which is 100,000 won. So amount is 100000.\n\nThe response should be a natural Korean reply. Since it's a transfer request, the response should confirm the transfer. The example given for \"transfer\" is \"송금해드릴까요?\" which is \"Will you receive the transfer?\" So here, the response would be similar. But the user is asking to transfer to \"여보\", so the response should be \"여보님께 100,000원을 이체해드릴까요?\" which translates to \"Will you receive 100,000 won transfer to you?\"\n\nWait, but the example for \"transfer\" is \"엄마님께 30,000원을 송금해드릴까요?\" So the structure is \"recipient님께 [amount]원을 [action]해드릴까요?\" So applying that here, it should be \"여보님께 100,000원을 이체해드릴까요?\".\n\nYes, that makes sense.

But the user is just saying to move on, not asking a question or confirming something. Wait, the example given for \"confirm\" is when someone confirms a previous action. But here, the user is just telling the bot to proceed without any specific action. So maybe it's a system response asking the bot to proceed. But the examples show that \"system_response\" is when the bot needs to ask again. Alternatively, maybe it's a cancel, but the user isn't canceling an existing transaction. Hmm.\n\nLooking at the examples, \"cancel\" is when the user wants to stop a previous action. But here, the user is just saying to move on, not canceling anything. So maybe it's a system response. The response would be something like \"알겠습니다. 지금부터 진행해드릴게요.\" But the user's message is \"그냥 넘어가줘\" which is \"just move on\" in Korean. So the intent is probably \"system_response\" because the user is instructing the bot to proceed without any specific action. The recipient and amount are null since there's no mention of a specific person or amount. The response should be a natural Korean reply acknowledging the instruction.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"intent\": \"system_response\",\n  \"amount\": null,\n  \"recipient\": null,\n  \"response\": \"알겠습니다. 지금부터 진행해드릴게요.\"\n}"

    "text": "엄마 송금해줘",
    "raw_output": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user says \"엄마 송금해줘\". So, they're asking to send money to their mother. The intent here is definitely transfer. The recipient is \"엄마\" which is \"mother\" in Korean. The amount isn't specified, so I should leave that as null. The response needs to be a natural Korean message. Since it's a transfer request, the system should confirm the send. The example given for \"transfer\" has \"송금해드릴까요?\" so I'll use that. Make sure to keep it simple and polite.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"intent\": \"transfer\",\n  \"amount\": null,\n  \"recipient\": \"엄마\",\n  \"response\": \"엄마님께 송금해드릴까요?\"\n}"

    "text": "아, 삼만원 보내는 거였지",
    "raw_output": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user said, \"아, 삼만원 보내는 거였지.\" So first, I need to figure out the intent. The words \"보내는 거였지\" suggest they're confirming a transfer. The amount is 30,000, and the recipient isn't mentioned. The intent here is transfer, but the user is confirming. Wait, the example given for \"confirm\" is when they say \"삼만원 보내는 거였지\" which is similar. So the intent should be confirm. The recipient is null because they didn't mention someone. The amount is 30000. The response should be a confirmation message. So the JSON would have intent as confirm, amount 30000, recipient null, and response like \"30,000원 송금 요청으로 확인했습니다.\"\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"intent\": \"confirm\",\n  \"amount\": 30000,\n  \"recipient\": null,\n  \"response\": \"30,000원 송금 요청으로 확인했습니다.\"\n}"

  {
    "text": "예금해줘",
    "raw_output": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user said \"예금해줘\". First, I need to determine the intent. The word \"예금\" means deposit, so the intent is likely transfer, but wait, transfer usually refers to sending money, while deposit is adding to an account. However, in some contexts, deposit can be considered as a form of transfer. But maybe the user is trying to add money to their account. But according to the guidelines, the intent should be transfer if it's about sending money. But depositing into an account might be a different category. Wait, the user is asking to deposit, which is adding money to their account. But the system's transfer intent is for sending money. So maybe the intent here is not transfer but maybe another. Let me check the intent list again. The options are transfer, confirm, cancel, inquiry, other, system_response. So if the user is asking to deposit, which is adding money, but the system's transfer is for sending. So maybe the intent is not transfer. But the user is asking to deposit, which is a form of adding money. However, the guidelines say that transfer is for sending, so maybe the intent here is not transfer. But the user might be confused. Alternatively, maybe the system's response is to confirm the deposit. Wait, but the user's message is \"예금해줘\" which is \"deposit, please\". So the intent might be \"inquiry\" if they want to know about their account, but that's not clear. Alternatively, maybe it's \"other\" because it's not a standard transfer. Wait, the user is asking to deposit, which is a form of adding money, but the system's transfer is for sending. So perhaps the intent is \"inquiry\" if they want to know about their account balance, but the message is just a request to deposit. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the intent is \"transfer\" because depositing is a form of transferring money to an account. But I need to check the guidelines again. The guidelines say that transfer is for sending money, so if the user is depositing, it's adding to their account, which is a different action. So maybe the intent is \"inquiry\" if they want to know about their account, but the message is just a request to deposit. Alternatively, maybe it's \"other\" because it's not a standard transfer. But the user is asking to deposit, which is a form of adding money. So perhaps the intent is \"inquiry\" if they want to know about their account, but the message is just a request to deposit. Wait, the user's message is \"예금해줘\" which is \"deposit, please\". So the intent is likely \"transfer\" because depositing is a form of transferring money to an account. But I need to check the guidelines again. The guidelines say that transfer is for sending money, but depositing is adding to an account. So maybe the intent is \"inquiry\" if they want to know about their account, but the message is a request to deposit. Alternatively, maybe the intent is \"transfer\" because the user is asking to add money to their account, which is a form of transfer. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the intent is \"other\" because it's not a standard transfer. But the user is asking to deposit, which is a form of transfer. So I think the intent here is \"transfer\". But I need to make sure. Let me think again. The user is asking to deposit, which is a form of transferring money to their account. So the intent is \"transfer\". But the system's transfer is for sending money, so maybe the intent is \"transfer\" even if it's depositing. So the intent is \"transfer\". Then the recipient is \"예금\" but the recipient is supposed to be the person's name, but the user didn't specify. So recipient is null. The amount is not specified, so null. The response would be something like \"예금을 처리해드릴까요?\" or \"예금을 추가해드릴까요?\" But the user's message is \"예금해줘\", so the response should be a confirmation. So the response would be \"예금을 처리해드릴까요?\" But the user is asking to deposit, so the system should confirm. So the final JSON would be intent: transfer, recipient: null, amount: null, response: \"예금을 처리해드릴까요?\".\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"intent\": \"transfer\",\n  \"amount\": null,\n  \"recipient\": null,\n  \"response\": \"예금을 처리해드릴까요?\"\n}"

    "raw_output": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking \"누구한테 보낼까요?\" which means \"To whom should I send it?\" in Korean. They're asking about the recipient, so the intent here is probably to confirm the recipient. But wait, the original question is about who to send it to, so maybe the intent is inquiry because they're asking for information. But the user hasn't specified the amount or the transfer yet. Let me check the instructions again.\n\nThe intent options are transfer, confirm, cancel, inquiry, other, system_response. The user is asking who to send it to, which is a question about the recipient. So the intent should be inquiry. The recipient is not specified yet, so it's null. The amount is also not mentioned, so null. The response should be a confirmation or a question. Since they're asking who to send it to, the response would be a question like \"받으시는 분은 누구인가요?\" or something similar. But according to the example, if it's confirm, they have a specific response.
