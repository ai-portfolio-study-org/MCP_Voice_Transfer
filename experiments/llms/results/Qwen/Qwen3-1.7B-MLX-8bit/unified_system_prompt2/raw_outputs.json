So amount is 100000.\n\nThe recipient is \"철수\" which is Jeon Soo. So recipient is \"철수\".\n\nThe response should be a natural question. Since it's a transfer, the response should ask if they want to send 100,000 won to Jeon Soo. So the response would be \"철수님께 100,000원을 송금해드릴까요?\".\n\nI need to make sure the JSON is correctly formatted with the intent, amount, recipient, and response.

The intent here is \"transfer\" because they're asking to send money. The amount is 30,000, and the recipient is \"엄마\" (mother). So the intent is transfer, amount is 30000, recipient is \"엄마\".\n\nNext, the response should be a natural conversation. Since it's a transfer, the response should ask if they want to send 30,000 won to their mother. The example given in the prompt is similar, so I'll follow that structure. The response should be something like, \"엄마님께 30,000원을 송금해드릴까요?\" which translates to \"Will you like to transfer 30,000 won to your mother?\"\n\nI need to make sure there are no other intents or other fields. The user didn't mention anything about confirming, canceling, or inquiring, so the intent is definitely transfer. The amount is clearly 30,000, and the recipient is the mother. The response is a straightforward confirmation question.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"intent\": \"transfer\",\n  \"amount\": 30000,\n  \"recipient\": \"엄마\",\n  \"response\": \"엄마님께 30,000원을 송금해드릴까요?\"\n}"

    "raw_output": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user said \"만원만 보내줘\". First, I need to determine the intent. The words \"만원\" mean \"ten thousand won\" in Korean, but in the context of a financial transaction, it's likely referring to a transfer. However, the user is asking to send only 10,000 won. But the exact intent here is a bit ambiguous. The user might be asking to send 10,000 won, but the exact intent could be \"transfer\" with the amount as 10,000 and recipient as \"someone\" (but the user didn't specify the recipient). Wait, the user didn't mention a recipient, so recipient would be null. But the amount is 10,000. So the intent is transfer, amount is 10,000, recipient is null. The response should be a question asking if they want to send 10,000 won to someone. But since the user didn't specify the recipient, the response should be general. So the JSON would have intent as transfer, amount 10000, recipient null, and the response as \"10,000 won을 보내드릴까요?\".\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"intent\": \"transfer\",\n  \"amount\": 10000,\n  \"recipient\": null,\n  \"response\": \"10,000 won을 보내드릴까요?\"\n}"

The amount isn't specified, so I'll put null for that. The recipient is \"엄마\" which is Grandma. The response should ask if they want to send the amount. Since the amount is missing, I need to ask for it. So the response would be something like, \"엄마님께 송금해드릴까요? 금액을 알려주세요.\" That makes sense.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"intent\": \"transfer\",\n  \"amount\": null,\n  \"recipient\": \"엄마\",\n  \"response\": \"엄마님께 송금해드릴까요? 금액을 알려주세요.\"\n}"

    "raw_output": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user said, \"나 송금하고 싶어\". Translating that, it's \"I want to transfer\" in Korean. So the intent here is likely \"transfer\". But I need to check if there's any other intent possible. The user is expressing a desire to make a transfer, so the intent is definitely transfer.\n\nNow, the amount and recipient are required. The user didn't mention any specific amount or recipient. So both amount and recipient should be null. \n\nFor the response, since it's a transfer request, I need to create a natural response. The example given was \"엄마님께 30,000원을 송금해드릴까요?\" which is a question asking if they want to transfer 30,000 to Grandma. But in this case, since the user hasn't specified the amount or recipient, I should make the response more general. Maybe something like, \"송금을 원하시면 언제든지 알려주세요!\" which means \"Please let me know when you want to transfer!\" But maybe the system expects a more specific response. Wait, the example uses a specific amount and recipient, but in this case, since they're not provided, the response should be general. So perhaps \"송금을 원하시면 언제든지 알려주세요!\" would be appropriate. But maybe the system expects a more direct question. Alternatively, maybe the user is just expressing the intent, and the response should be a confirmation. But according to the instructions, when the intent is transfer, the response should be a sentence that asks if they want to transfer. So the response should be a question. So the response would be something like \"송금을 원하시면 언제든지 알려주세요!\" which is a general question. But maybe the system expects a more specific response. Wait, the example uses a specific amount and recipient, but in this case, since they are not provided, the response should be general. So the response would be \"송금을 원하시면 언제든지 알려주세요!\" which is a common way to ask for confirmation. So the JSON would have intent as transfer, amount and recipient as null, and the response as that sentence.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"intent\": \"transfer\",\n  \"amount\": null,\n  \"recipient\": null,\n  \"response\": \"송금을 원하시면 언제든지 알려주세요!\"\n}"

They didn't mention transferring money, confirming, canceling, or anything else. The amount isn't specified, so that's null. The recipient is also not mentioned. The response should be something like \"가스비 납부 방법을 알려드릴까요?\" which translates to \"How can I pay the gas bill?\" in Korean. I need to make sure the JSON structure is correct with the intent as \"inquiry\", amount as null, recipient as null, and the response in Korean.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"intent\": \"inquiry\",\n  \"amount\": null,\n  \"recipient\": null,\n  \"response\": \"가스비 납부 방법을 알려드릴까요?\"\n}"

    "raw_output": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking, \"내 계좌에 얼마 남았어?\" which translates to \"How much is left in my account?\" in Korean. So the intent here is likely an inquiry about the balance.\n\nLooking at the instructions, the intent should be \"inquiry\". The amount isn't specified, so I need to set that to null. The recipient isn't mentioned either, so that's also null. The response should be something like \"잔액 조회\" or \"상태 확인\" related. \n\nThe example given for inquiry uses \"잔액 조회\", so I should use that. The response should be a question asking for the balance. So the JSON would have intent as \"inquiry\", amount null, recipient null, and the response as \"잔액 조회\" or the actual question. Wait, the example response was \"엄마님께 30,000원을 송금해드릴까요?\" which is a confirmation. But for inquiry, it should be a question. So maybe \"계좌 잔액을 확인해드릴까요?\" or similar.\n\nBut the user's question is a direct inquiry, so the response should be a question. So the response field should be \"계좌 잔액을 확인해드릴까요?\" or something like that. Let me check the example again. The example for inquiry had \"잔액 조회\" as the intent, but the response was a question. So the response should be a question asking for the balance. So the response would be \"계좌 잔액을 확인해드릴까요?\" or similar. \n\nSo the final JSON would be:\n\n{\n  \"intent\": \"inquiry\",\n  \"amount\": null,\n  \"recipient\": null,\n  \"response\": \"계좌 잔액을 확인해드릴까요?\"\n}\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"intent\": \"inquiry\",\n  \"amount\": null,\n  \"recipient\": null,\n  \"response\": \"계좌 잔액을 확인해드릴까요?\"\n}"

So the intent here is probably a transfer, but I need to check.\n\nFirst, the intent. The user is asking to send something again, which is a transfer. So intent should be transfer. The amount isn't specified, so amount is null. The recipient is \"그 사람\" which is \"that person\", so recipient is \"그 사람\".\n\nThen the response. For a transfer, the response should be a question asking if they want to send the amount again. Since the amount isn't specified, I need to ask for the amount and recipient again. But the user hasn't provided the amount, so the response should be something like, \"그 사람에게 또 보내줄까요? 금액을 알려주세요.\"\n\nWait, but the example shows \"송금\" and the response. So maybe the response is \"그 사람에게 또 보내줄까요?\" with the amount and recipient as per the user's message. But since the user didn't specify the amount, it's null. So the response should be the question asking for the amount and recipient again. But the example in the prompt shows the response as a question. So the response would be \"그 사람에게 또 보내줄까요? 금액을 알려주세요.\"\n\nBut the user's message is just \"그 사람한테 또 보내줘\", so the response should be a question asking for the amount and recipient.

The user is now asking to send the same, so the intent should still be transfer. The amount and recipient would be the same as before. So the JSON should have intent as transfer, amount 30000, recipient \"엄마\", and the response should be a confirmation question like \"엄마님께 30,000원을 송금해드릴까요?\".\n\nI need to make sure there's no other intent here.

    "raw_output": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user said \"송금할래\". That's Korean for \"I want to transfer money\". So the intent is definitely transfer. But wait, the amount and recipient aren't mentioned. The user just says \"송금할래\" without any specific details. So according to the instructions, if the amount isn't specified, it should be null. Similarly, the recipient is also not provided. So the response should be a question asking for the amount and recipient. The example given in the instructions shows that when intent is transfer and there's no amount or recipient, the response is something like \"송금할래\" with a question mark. Wait, the example had \"엄마님께 30,000원을 송금해드릴까요?\" but in this case, since there's no amount or recipient, maybe it's \"송금할래\" with a question mark. But the user's message is just \"송금할래\", so maybe the response should be a confirmation that they want to transfer, but without the details. Wait, the example shows that when the intent is transfer and the amount and recipient are not present, the response is \"송금할래\" with a question mark. But the user's message is just \"송금할래\", so maybe the response is \"송금을 하시겠어요?\" or something like that. But according to the instructions, the response should be a natural language response. So maybe the response is \"송금을 하시겠어요?\" to confirm their request. But I need to make sure. Let me check the instructions again. The response should be a natural language response based on the intent. For transfer intent, the response should be a question asking for the amount and recipient. But if the user hasn't provided those, then the response should be a question like \"송금할래\" with the details missing. Wait, the example given in the instructions has the response as \"엄마님께 30,000원을 송금해드릴까요?\" which is a question asking for the amount and recipient. But in this case, the user hasn't provided any details. So the response should be a question asking for the amount and recipient. So the response would be \"송금할래\" with the details missing.

But the example shows that when the amount is not present, the response is \"엄마님께 30,000원을 송금해드릴까요?\" which is a question. So in this case, since there's no amount or recipient, the response should be a question asking for those details. So the response would be \"송금을 하시겠어요?\" or similar.

Maybe something like, \"이체 수수료는 어떻게 되나요? 계좌 번호나 이체 금액을 알려주시면 확인해 드릴 수 있습니다.\" Wait, but the user is asking about the fee, so maybe a more direct question.

It's just a normal statement about having lunch with the father. So the intent here would be \"other\" because it's not related to financial transactions.\n\nThe amount and recipient are also not mentioned.

So the intent is transfer, amount is 10000, recipient is \"아빠\".\n\nNext, the response should be a natural conversation. For a transfer, it's \"송금\" related.

The recipient is \"여보\" which is \"you\" in Korean, so that's the recipient. \n\nNow, the response needs to be natural. For a transfer, it should ask if they want to transfer 100,000 to \"you\".

But the exact intent isn't clear. The possible intents are transfer, confirm, cancel, inquiry, other, or system_response.\n\nLooking at the sentence, there's no mention of transferring money, confirming a transaction, canceling, or inquiring. It's more like a directive to proceed without any action. So the intent might be \"system_response\" because the user is telling the system to just go ahead.\n\nNext, the amount and recipient are not mentioned, so they should be null. The response should be a natural language reply.

The amount isn't specified, so that's null. The recipient is \"엄마\" which is \"mother\" in Korean, so that's the recipient.\n\nNow, the response needs to be natural. For a transfer, it should ask if they want to send the amount. Since the amount is null, I should ask for the amount. But wait, the user didn't mention the amount, so maybe I should prompt them to provide the amount. But the example shows \"송금해드릴까요?\" which is \"Can you send the money?\" So maybe the response is asking if they want to send the money, but since the amount is unknown, they need to specify it. So the response would be something like \"엄마님께 [amount]원을 송금해드릴까요?\" but since the amount is null, maybe it's \"엄마님께 송금해드릴까요?\" but the example shows the amount as 30000, which is a specific number. Wait, the user's message doesn't have an amount, so the response should ask for the amount. But the example in the prompt has a specific amount.

So the intent here is probably \"inquiry\" because they want to know who the transfer is being sent to.\n\nLooking at the instructions, if the intent is inquiry, the response should be related to checking the status or balance. But the user is specifically asking who the recipient is. Wait, the example given for inquiry is \"잔액 조회\" or \"상태 확인\". But in this case, the user is asking about the recipient, which is more about the target person. However, the instructions say that for inquiry, the response should be related to the inquiry. But maybe the system is designed to handle this as an inquiry for the recipient.\n\nWait, the user is asking \"누구한테 보낼까요?\" which is a question about the recipient. So the intent here is \"inquiry\" because they want to know the recipient. The response should be a natural language response asking for the recipient's name. But according to the example, when the intent is inquiry, the response is something like \"잔액 조회\" or \"상태 확인\". But in this case, the user is asking about the recipient, which is a different type of inquiry. Hmm, maybe the system is designed to handle this as an inquiry for the recipient, but the example shows \"잔액 조회\" which is balance check. So perhaps the system expects that when the user asks about the recipient, it's considered an inquiry, and the response would be a question asking for the recipient's name.\n\nBut according to the instructions, for intent \"inquiry\", the response should be related to the inquiry. So if the user is asking \"누구한테 보낼까요?\" which is asking for the recipient, then the response should be a question like \"수신자 이름을 알려주세요.\" or something similar. But the example given in the instructions for inquiry is \"잔액 조회\" or \"상태 확인\", which are different. So maybe the system is designed to handle this as an inquiry for the recipient, but the example shows balance checks. However, the user's question is about the recipient, so perhaps the intent is \"inquiry\" and the response is a question asking for the recipient's name.\n\nBut the user hasn't provided the amount or recipient yet. So in this case, the user is just asking who to send it to, so the intent is \"inquiry\" and the response would be a question to get the recipient's name. But according to the instructions, the response should be a natural language response. So the response would be something like \"수신자 이름을 알려주세요.\" or \"누구에게 송금할까요?\".\n\nBut the example given in the instructions for inquiry is \"잔액 조회\" or \"상태 확인\", which are different. So maybe the system is designed to handle this as an inquiry for the recipient, but the response is a question. So the JSON would have intent \"inquiry\", amount null, recipient null, and the response as a question.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"intent\": \"inquiry\",\n  \"amount\": null,\n  \"recipient\": null,\n  \"response\": \"수신자 이름을 알려주세요.\"\n}"
