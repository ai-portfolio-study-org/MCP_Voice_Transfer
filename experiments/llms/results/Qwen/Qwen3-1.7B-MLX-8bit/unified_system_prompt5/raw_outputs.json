    "raw_output": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to send 100,000 won to Jeongso. First, I need to determine the intent. The key words are \"보내줘\" which is \"send\" in Korean, so the intent is definitely transfer. Next, the amount is \"오천 원\" which is 10,000 won. The recipient is \"철수\" so that's the recipient. The response should be a confirmation. The example given for similar cases uses \"송금하실 대상과 금액을 말씀해주세요.\" but since the user already specified the amount and recipient, the response can be a confirmation like \"철수님께 10,000원을 송금해드릴까요?\".\n\nWait, but the user wrote \"오천 원\" which is 1,000, not 10,000. Oh, I need to check that. \"오천 원\" is 1,000, so the amount should be 1,000. So the amount is 1,000. The recipient is Jeongso. So the response should be \"철수님께 1,000원을 송금해드릴까요?\".\n\nBut the user might have a typo, but I have to go with the given text. So the correct amount is 1,000. So the final answer should have intent as transfer, amount 1000, recipient Jeongso, and the response as the confirmation.\n</think>\n\n{\"intent\": \"transfer\", \"amount\": 1000, \"recipient\": \"철수\", \"response\": \"철수님께 1,000원을 송금해드릴까요?\"}"

    "raw_output": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wrote \"엄마한테 3만원만\". First, I need to determine the intent. The word \"만\" usually means \"only\" or \"just\", so the user is saying \"only 30,000 won\" to their mother. That points towards a transfer intent.\n\nNext, the amount. The number is 3만원, which is 30,000 won. So the amount should be 30000. The recipient is \"엄마\", which is \"mother\" in Korean, so that's the recipient.\n\nNow, the response. The user is asking to send 30,000 won to their mother. The system should confirm the transfer. The example given for \"송금할래\" was a confirmation request, so here, the response should be a confirmation. The example response for transfer was \"엄마님께 30,000원을 송금해드릴까요?\" which is a confirmation question. So the response here should be similar, asking if they want to send 30,000 won to their mother.\n\nI need to make sure that the intent is transfer, amount is 30000, recipient is 엄마, and the response is the confirmation question. Also, check if there are any other possible intents, but since the user is clearly asking to send money, it's definitely transfer. No other intents like cancel or inquiry here. So the final answer should be as per the example.\n</think>\n\n{\"intent\": \"transfer\", \"amount\": 30000, \"recipient\": \"엄마\", \"response\": \"엄마님께 30,000원을 송금해드릴까요?\"}"

The amount is \"만원\" which is 10,000 won. The recipient isn't specified, so it's null. The response should be a confirmation question. The example given for \"송금할래\" had a response asking for the recipient and amount.

The amount isn't specified, so it should be null. The response should be a confirmation question. The example given for \"송금할래\" had a response asking for the recipient and amount. So here, the response should be something like \"엄마님께 10,000원을 송금해드릴까요?\" but since the amount is not specified, maybe just the confirmation. Wait, but the user didn't mention an amount, so the response should be asking for the amount. Wait, but the original example for \"송금할래\" had the response asking for the recipient and amount. So in this case, since the user just said \"엄마한테 보내줘\" without an amount, the response should be asking for the amount. But the user might be expecting a confirmation. Hmm. Let me check the examples again. For \"송금할래\", the response was \"송금하실 대상과 금액을 말씀해주세요.\" So if the user says \"보내줘\" without any amount, the response should be asking for the amount. But in this case, the user is just saying \"엄마한테 보내줘\", which is \"send to mother\". So the intent is transfer, recipient is 엄마, amount is null. The response should be asking for the amount. So the response would be \"엄마님께 금액을 알려주세요.\" But maybe the system expects a more natural response. Let me think. The example for \"송금할래\" had a response asking for the recipient and amount. So in this case, since the user didn't mention an amount, the response should be asking for the amount. So the response would be \"엄마님께 금액을 알려주세요.\" But maybe the system expects a more concise response. Alternatively, if the user is just saying \"보내줘\" without any amount, the response is to ask for the amount. So the final answer would be intent: transfer, amount: null, recipient: 엄마, response: \"엄마님께 금액을 알려주세요.\"\n</think>\n\n{\"intent\": \"transfer\", \"amount\": null, \"recipient\": \"엄마\", \"response\": \"엄마님께 금액을 알려주세요.\"}"

The user is expressing a desire to transfer money, so that's definitely \"transfer\". But I need to make sure there's no other intent. The text is straightforward, no mention of confirming, canceling, or other.\n\nNext, the amount. The user didn't specify how much. They just said \"송금하고 싶어\" which is \"I want to transfer\". So amount is null.\n\nRecipient: They didn't mention who. So recipient is null.\n\nResponse: The user is asking to transfer, but the system needs to ask for the recipient and amount. So the response should be something like \"송금하실 대상과 금액을 말씀해주세요.\" which is the standard response for when you want to transfer but haven't provided details.\n\nWait, the example given for \"송금할래\" had the response as \"송금하실 대상과 금액을 말씀해주세요.\" So yes, that's correct.

The user is asking, \"가스비 내야 하는데 어떻게 해야 해?\" which translates to \"I need to pay the gas fee, how do I do that?\" So, the intent here is probably about paying a gas fee. But I need to check the categories provided.\n\nThe possible intents are transfer, confirm, cancel, inquiry, other, or system_response. The user is asking how to pay the gas fee, which is a general question. Since they're asking for steps or methods, it's not a transfer request. It's more of an inquiry into how to handle the payment. So the intent would be \"inquiry\".\n\nNow, the amount and recipient are null because the user hasn't specified the amount or the recipient. The response should be a natural Korean explanation. The user is asking \"how to do it,\" so the response should be a step-by-step guide or instructions. But since the user hasn't provided specific details, the response should be a general instruction. \n\nSo, the intent is \"inquiry\", amount and recipient are null, and the response is something like \"가스비를 내기 위해 필요한 절차를 알려드릴 수 있습니다. 일반적으로는 가스 계약서를 확인하고 납부 방법을 따라야 합니다.\" But maybe more concise. Let me check the example again. For \"inquiry\", the response is a confirmation of the amount and recipient. But here, since there's no specific info, it's a general inquiry. So the response should be a question asking for the amount and recipient. Wait, but the user is asking how to pay, not asking for confirmation. So maybe the response is a general instruction. \n\nAlternatively, since the user is asking how to pay, it's an inquiry into the process. So the response should be a step-by-step guide. But the example for \"inquiry\" in the given examples has a response like \"30,000원 송금 요청으로 확인했습니다.\" So maybe here, the response should be a general instruction. \n\nSo, the final answer would be intent: inquiry, amount: null, recipient: null, response: \"가스비를 내기 위해 필요한 절차를 알려드릴 수 있습니다. 일반적으로는 가스 계약서를 확인하고 납부 방법을 따라야 합니다.\"\n</think>\n\n{\"intent\": \"inquiry\", \"amount\": null, \"recipient\": null, \"response\": \"가스비를 내기 위해 필요한 절차를 알려드릴 수 있습니다. 일반적으로는 가스 계약서를 확인하고 납부 방법을 따라야 합니다.\"}"

I need to determine the intent, amount, recipient, and response based on this query.\n\nFirst, the intent. The user is asking about the balance in their account. The possible intents are transfer, confirm, cancel, inquiry, other, or system_response. Since they're asking about the balance, that's related to checking information, so the intent should be \"inquiry\". \n\nNext, the amount. The user is asking how much is left, but they didn't specify a particular amount. So the amount would be null because there's no specific number mentioned.\n\nThe recipient is the user themselves, as they're asking about their own account. So the recipient should be \"내자신\" or \"자신\" but in the example, when the user says \"내 계좌에 얼마 남았어?\" the recipient is \"내자신\". However, in the examples given, sometimes it's just \"자신\" or the name. But in the example provided, for \"내 계좌에 얼마 남았어?\" the recipient is \"내자신\". So I'll go with that.\n\nFor the response, since it's an inquiry about the balance, the system should provide a response asking for the specific details. The example given for \"inquiry\" was \"송금 요청으로 확인했습니다.\" but in this case, it's about balance. So the response should be something like \"계좌 잔액을 알려드릴게요.\" or similar. But the example for \"inquiry\" in the given examples is \"송금 요청으로 확인했습니다.\" which is for confirming a transfer. So maybe the response here should be a question asking for the balance. But the user is asking for the balance, so the system should respond by asking for the specific details. However, the user hasn't provided any specific information yet. So the response should be a question to get the necessary details. But in the example, when the user says \"아, 삼만원 보내는 거였지\", the response is \"30,000원 송금 요청으로 확인했습니다.\" So for this case, the response would be a question to get the balance. But the user is asking for the balance, so the system should respond by asking for the balance. However, the user hasn't provided any specific information yet. So the response would be something like \"계좌 잔액을 알려드릴게요.\" or \"계좌에 남은 금액을 알려드릴게요.\" But the exact wording needs to be in Korean. \n\nWait, the user is asking \"내 계좌에 얼마 남았어?\" which is a direct question about the balance. So the system should respond by asking for the specific details. But in the example, when the user says \"내 계좌에 얼마 남았어?\" the response is \"계좌 잔액을 알려드릴게요.\" So the response would be a confirmation that the system will provide the balance. But the user hasn't provided any specific information yet. So the response is a question to get the necessary details. However, the user is asking for the balance, so the system should respond by asking for the specific details. But in the example, when the user says \"내 계좌에 얼마 남았어?\" the response is \"계좌 잔액을 알려드릴게요.\" So the response is a confirmation that the system will provide the balance. \n\nSo putting it all together, the intent is \"inquiry\", amount is null, recipient is \"내자신\", and the response is \"계좌 잔액을 알려드릴게요.\"\n</think>\n\n{\"intent\": \"inquiry\", \"amount\": null, \"recipient\": \"내자신\", \"response\": \"계좌 잔액을 알려드릴게요.\"}"

The user is talking about sending something to someone again. The word \"보내줘\" is a common way to say \"send to\" in Korean. The mention of \"또\" means \"again,\" so it's about sending again. That points to the transfer intent.\n\nNext, the amount. The sentence doesn't mention any specific number. So amount should be null.\n\nRecipient is \"그 사람\" which is \"that person.\" The user is referring to someone else, so the recipient is \"그 사람\" or \"그 사람님\" if it's a formal address. But since the original sentence just says \"그 사람\" without a title, I'll use \"그 사람\" as the recipient.\n\nFor the response, since the intent is transfer and the user is asking to send again, the system should confirm the action. The example given for \"송금할래\" had a response asking for the recipient and amount. Here, since the user is asking to send again, the response should be a confirmation. But the user hasn't specified the amount or recipient yet. Wait, the original sentence is \"그 사람한테 또 보내줘\" which is a request to send again. But the system needs to ask for the details. However, in the example, when the user says \"송금할래\", the response is asking for recipient and amount. So here, since the user is asking to send again but hasn't provided the details, the response should be asking for the amount and recipient. But the user's message is just the request, not the details. So the response should be a confirmation that they want to send again, but the system needs to prompt for the details. However, in the example, when the user says \"송금할래\", the response is asking for the details. So in this case, the user is asking to send again, but the system needs to ask for the amount and recipient. But the user hasn't provided those yet.

The word \"보내줘\" is a common way to ask someone to send something, so the intent is likely transfer. But the user is saying \"아까랑 똑같이\" which means \"the same as before\". So they want to send the same amount and recipient as before.\n\nBut wait, the user hasn't mentioned the amount or recipient yet. In the example, when the user says \"삼만원 보내줘\", the system asks for the recipient. Here, the user is just saying \"아까랑 똑같이 보내줘\" without specifying the amount or recipient.

The task is to analyze this sentence for intent, amount, recipient, and response.\n\nFirst, the intent. The user is mentioning a meal with their father, which is a social activity, not related to transferring money. So the intent here is probably not transfer, confirm, cancel, or inquiry. The system_response might be relevant if there's a follow-up question, but in this case, it's just a statement. So the intent would be 'other' since it's a daily conversation and not a transaction.\n\nNext, the amount. There's no mention of any money being transferred or spent. The user didn't mention a specific amount, so the amount should be null.\n\nRecipient: The user is talking about having lunch with their father, so the recipient is \"아빠\" (father). But the example shows that if the recipient is not specified, it's null. However, in this case, the user is referring to their father, so the recipient should be \"아빠\".\n\nResponse: The response should be a natural Korean reply. Since the user is just informing about the meal, the response would be a simple statement like \"오늘 아빠랑 점심을 먹었어요.\" But according to the guidelines, if the intent is other, the response should be a short, conversational reply. So maybe something like \"오늘 아빠랑 점심을 먹었어요. 어땠어?\" to ask how they felt.\n\nWait, but the example for 'other' has a response that's a short statement. Let me check the example again. For instance, in the example where the user says \"송금할래\", the response is \"송금하실 대상과 금액을 말씀해주세요.\" So for a general statement, the response is a simple statement. So in this case, the response would be \"오늘 아빠랑 점심을 먹었어요.\" But maybe the user wants a more conversational reply. However, the instruction says that for 'other' intent, the response should be a short, conversational reply.

The example given for \"transfer\" has the response asking if they want to send the amount.

The response should be a simple statement. Since the intent isn't transfer, confirm, cancel, or inquiry, it's probably \"other\" or \"system_response\". But the user is not asking for a system response. \n\nWait, the user is just saying \"just go over\", which is a command. So the intent might be \"other\" because it's not related to transactions. But the example for \"system_response\" is when the system asks for more info. Here, the user is giving a command, so maybe \"other\" is correct. \n\nBut the user might be expecting a system response. However, the instruction says to generate a natural Korean response. If the intent is \"other\", the response would be a simple statement like \"Okay, I'll just go over.\" But the user's message is the instruction, not a request. \n\nAlternatively, if the intent is \"system_response\", but that's when the system asks for more info. The user is not asking for anything, just saying \"just go over\". So maybe \"other\" is the correct intent. \n\nSo the final answer would be intent: other, amount: null, recipient: null, response: \"Okay, I'll just go over.\"\n</think>\n\n{\"intent\": \"other\", \"amount\": null, \"recipient\": null, \"response\": \"Okay, I'll just go over.\"}"

    "text": "엄마 송금해줘",
    "raw_output": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wrote \"엄마 송금해줘\". So, they're asking to send money to their mother. The intent here is definitely transfer. The recipient is \"엄마\", which is \"mother\" in Korean. The amount isn't specified, so I should put null for that. The response should be a confirmation question. The example given for \"송금할래\" had a response asking for the recipient and amount. So here, the response should be something like \"엄마님께 몇 원을 송금하시겠어요?\" to confirm the transfer. Let me check the rules again. The amount is null because it's not mentioned. Recipient is \"엄마\". Intent is transfer. Response is a confirmation. Yep, that fits.\n</think>\n\n{\"intent\": \"transfer\", \"amount\": null, \"recipient\": \"엄마\", \"response\": \"엄마님께 몇 원을 송금하시겠어요?\"}"

    "text": "아, 삼만원 보내는 거였지",
    "raw_output": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user said, \"아, 삼만원 보내는 거였지.\" First, I need to determine the intent. The words \"보내는 거였지\" suggest they're confirming a transfer. The amount is 30,000, so the intent should be transfer. The recipient isn't specified, so it's null. The response should be a confirmation. The example given for \"confirm\" had \"30,000원 송금 요청으로 확인했습니다.\" So I'll use that structure. The response should be something like \"30,000원 송금 요청으로 확인했습니다.\" Let me check if there's any other possible intent. Since they're confirming, it's definitely confirm. The recipient is null here. Alright, that makes sense.\n</think>\n\n{\"intent\": \"confirm\", \"amount\": 30000, \"recipient\": null, \"response\": \"30,000원 송금 요청으로 확인했습니다.\"}"

    "text": "예금해줘",
    "raw_output": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wrote \"예금해줘\". The task is to extract intent, amount, recipient, and response.\n\nFirst, the intent. The user is asking to deposit money. But looking at the possible intents, the options are transfer, confirm, cancel, inquiry, other, or system_response. The user's request is about depositing, which is related to transferring money. So the intent should be transfer.\n\nNext, the amount. The user didn't mention any specific amount. The example shows that if there's no amount, it's null. So here, amount is null.\n\nRecipient: The user didn't specify who they're depositing for. The example shows that if recipient isn't mentioned, it's null. So recipient is null.\n\nResponse: The user is asking to deposit, so the system should respond with a confirmation. The example for \"송금할래\" had a response asking for the recipient and amount. Here, since the user didn't specify, the response should be a general confirmation. Maybe something like \"예금을 처리해드릴게요.\" But need to check the example. In the example for \"송금할래\", the response was \"송금하실 대상과 금액을 말씀해주세요.\" So for \"예금해줘\", the response should be similar, asking for the details. But the user's message is \"예금해줘\" which is a direct request. Wait, maybe the user is asking to deposit, but the system needs to confirm. So the response should be a confirmation that they can process the deposit, but since the user hasn't provided the details, the response should be asking for the recipient and amount. But the user's message is just \"예금해줘\", which is a request. So the response should be a confirmation that they can process the deposit, but since the details are missing, the response would be asking for the necessary information. However, in the example for \"송금할래\", the response was a question. So here, the response should be similar, asking for the recipient and amount. So the response would be \"예금을 처리해드릴게요. 예금하실 대상과 금액을 알려주세요.\"\n\nBut wait, the user's message is \"예금해줘\" which is \"deposit it\" in Korean. So maybe the user is asking to deposit money, but the system needs to confirm. So the response should be a confirmation that they can process the deposit, but since the details are missing, the response is asking for the recipient and amount. So the response would be \"예금을 처리해드릴게요. 예금하실 대상과 금액을 알려주세요.\"\n\nSo putting it all together: intent is transfer, amount is null, recipient is null, response is the confirmation asking for details.\n</think>\n\n{\"intent\": \"transfer\", \"amount\": null, \"recipient\": null, \"response\": \"예금을 처리해드릴게요. 예금하실 대상과 금액을 알려주세요.\"}"

    "raw_output": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking \"누구한테 보낼까요?\" which translates to \"Who should I send it to?\" in English. The intent here is about determining the recipient of a transfer. But the user hasn't mentioned the recipient yet. The system needs to ask for the recipient's name. According to the instructions, if there's a transfer intent, recipient and amount are required. Since the user hasn't provided any information about the recipient or amount, the intent should be 'inquiry' because they're asking for the recipient. The response should prompt them to provide the recipient's name. So the intent is 'inquiry', recipient is null, amount is null, and the response is asking for the recipient's name.\n</think>\n\n{\"intent\": \"inquiry\", \"amount\": null, \"recipient\": null, \"response\": \"받으시는 분의 이름을 알려주세요.\"}"
